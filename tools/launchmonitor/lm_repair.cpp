// lm_repair — put the `lm.*` metric rows back into a swing.json from the raw
// `launchMonitor` block that is already in the file.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A launch monitor reading lands in a swing.json in two places: the raw
// `launchMonitor` block, and one `lm.`-prefixed row per field inside analysis.metrics[].
// Only the second has readers — the reload path takes `kind` out of the raw block and
// nothing else (swing_doc.cpp, readSwingJson), and the session board, the tiles and every
// `lm.` grade read the metric rows. Until the carry-forward in writeSwingJson, re-analysis
// rebuilt analysis.metrics[] from the stages alone and dropped every row, because no stage
// produces one: a reading is paired to a swing AFTER the stages have run. The result was a
// file that still looked complete and a launch monitor that read as never connected.
//
// The repair is exact rather than reconstructive. lm::fieldDefs() is the single enumeration
// point for both shapes — `rawName` names the raw column, `key` names the metric — so every
// value the rows carried is still sitting in the block under a different name.
//
// IT GOES THROUGH THE PRODUCTION EMITTER, deliberately. Rebuilding the rows here would be a
// second implementation of updateLaunchMonitor(), and the derived `compoundMiss` would be a
// second implementation of a classifier whose own header exists to stop exactly that (see
// lm_inferred_reads.h — "two derivations of one judgement is the drift the whole header is
// arranged to prevent"). So this reads the block back into a LaunchMonitorReading and hands
// it to SwingDocWriter::updateLaunchMonitor(), which is idempotent by construction: it
// rewrites the raw block, strips any surviving `lm.` and derived rows before re-adding, and
// refreshes the summary sidecar guard that the rewrite invalidates.
//
// Safe to re-run. Safe on a swing that never had a reading (there is nothing to read back,
// and it is skipped). Reports what it changed and touches nothing else in the document.
//
//   lm_repair [--dry-run] <path> [<path> ...]

// case every swing_* beneath it is visited.
