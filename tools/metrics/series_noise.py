"""Baseline probe for metric-series noise, degeneracy and foreshortening.

Phase 0 of docs/implementation/metric_presentation_honesty_impl_plan.md (tasks 0.1-0.3).
This is the one-off probe from 2026-09-04 made repeatable: it reports, per (swing, key),
how noisy the persisted curve is, what the CURRENT chart-style PEAK RATE tile would read,
what the curve does inside the proposed P1-P7 domain, and - for the two body-line angles -
how far the hip/shoulder line has foreshortened out of the image plane.

Nothing here derives a product number. It measures what we ship today so the design's
definition of done (design doc section 7) has a before to be judged against.

stdlib only, deliberately: it has to run on the Mac, on GOLFSIMPC and over the SMB share
with no environment to set up. Every swing.json is opened exactly once (the share is SMB
and the files run to tens of MB).

Usage:
    series_noise.py ROOT [--keys k1,k2,...] [--out CSV] [--only SUBSTR]
