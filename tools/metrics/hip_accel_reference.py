"""Reference acceleration for the motion-adaptive smoother window (Phase 0).

Phase 0 of ~/.claude/plans/buzzing-frolicking-valley.md / C14 of
docs/implementation/metric_presentation_honesty_phase5_contracts.md. C14's `accel` policy
scales the per-step process noise by `clamp((|a| / aRefPxS2)^expo, minScale, 1)` where |a| is
the smoothed acceleration magnitude of the keypoint in px/s². `aRefPxS2` ships as a
placeholder (20000.0) until this probe measures it. This script measures nothing else: it
reports, per swing and per joint, how big |a| actually is when the joint is QUIET (still
address, backswing) and when it is MOVING (transition through impact), so aRef can be set to
the value that separates the two.

What it reads
-------------
`pose2d.smoothed` (the same track the producers read, and the same track C14's pass 1 would
produce) and falls back to `pose2d.frames` with `smoothed=0` in the CSV so a document without
a cached smoothed track is never silently mixed in with the rest.

Pixels, not normalised units
----------------------------
`kp` is 133 keypoints x 3 floats (x, y, conf), normalised 0..1 against the FULL camera frame.
src/Analysis/pose_smoother.cpp smoothPoseTrack does `zx = kp.x() * W` with W/H taken from the
face-on CameraFormat (wrist_analyzer.cpp PoseSmoothStage passes `cfmt->width/height`), so
aRefPxS2 lives in those pixels and this probe has to use the same ones. In swing.json that
format is `streams[<camera>].source.{width,height}` for the video streams in camera order
(`encoded` is the mp4, which happens to match today); `analysis.club.frameWidth/frameHeight`
is used as a cross-check and as the fallback when the stream block is absent. The `dims_src`
column says which was used for each swing. NB the corpus is NOT one format: the June/July
sessions are 720x1024 and the 08-18 sessions 1280x1024, so a px/s² threshold is per-format
and the wider frame reads larger for the same physical motion.

Acceleration
------------
Central differences on the NON-UNIFORM pose timestamps (the tracks jitter by several ms):

    a_k ~ 2 * [ (p_{k+1} - p_k)/dt_plus - (p_k - p_{k-1})/dt_minus ] / (dt_plus + dt_minus)

with dt in seconds and p in pixels, then |a| = hypot(a_x, a_y). This is the standard
non-uniform second difference; it degrades to the uniform 2nd difference when dt+ == dt-.

Windows (a swing missing Address, Top or Impact is skipped and counted)
    address   [Address - 300 ms, Address]   - the body is still: this is the noise floor
    backswing [Address, Top]                - slow, mostly quiet
    downswing [Top, Impact]                 - the fast stretch the corridors are seeded in
    post      [Impact, Impact + 250 ms]     - still fast, decelerating

Per ladder position: the median |a| within +/-25 ms of each of P1..P7 (Address 0,
ShaftParallelBack 12, MidBackswing 8, Top 2, ArmParallelDown 13, Delivery 9, Impact 5) is
reported as a_p1..a_p7 with its sample count. aRef is chosen from the IMPACT side - the
smallest value that keeps the scale saturated at 1.0 through P6-P7 on essentially every swing
- and NOT from the still address, because outside the 08-18 sessions the address window
carries real setup motion and reads as loud as the downswing.

Joints: hip centre (mean of COCO 11 left / 12 right), lead knee and lead ankle. Lead is the
target side: `athlete.handedness` "Right" => the LEFT leg leads => knee 13, ankle 15 (and
mirrored for "Left"). That matches wrist_analyzer.cpp's `leftLeads = (handedness != 2)`.
