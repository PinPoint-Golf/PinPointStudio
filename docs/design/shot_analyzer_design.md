## Executive summary

The analyzer is built as a **degradable, additive** pipeline behind the current `analyze()` worker-thread
interface. Nine named layers — **Decode → Detection → Reconstruction → Fusion → Cleanup → Skeleton →
Metrics → Scoring → Feedback** — compose per session type. Each layer is the natural home for one concern:

- **Cameras** give metric 3D joint positions when a down-the-line + face-on pair is **calibrated** and triangulated.
- **IMUs** supply absolute segment orientation (wrist flexion, forearm rotation, club shaft) that vision cannot, and reconstruct occluded segments straight through motion blur.
- **Offline smoothing** (Kalman + RTS backward smoother over the whole window) and **IK** (fixed bone lengths + ROM limits) produce a stable `SkeletonTimeline` that also drives `BodyVizView` replay.
- **Metrics** (X-factor & stretch, kinematic sequence, wrist flex/ext, sway/thrust/lift, swing plane, tempo…) are phase-anchored on the exact impact timestamp.
- **Scoring** is **transparent and non-compensatory**: every number traces to one metric, one reference band, one weight, aggregated by a **weighted geometric mean** so a single severe fault cannot be averaged away, with ranked plain-English faults + drills.

It **degrades gracefully** across capability tiers built on two independent axes — cameras *and*
IMUs — with **`Mono3D+IMU`** (one calibrated face-on camera + sparse IMUs) as the **first-class
single-camera path**, not a degraded fallback: every orientation metric (X-factor, wrist, forearm,
shaft lean, body kinematic sequence) is IMU-derived and camera-count-independent, so a lone face-on
camera yields a complete coaching product on day one. A second (down-the-line) camera and a future
club-shaft IMU are *enhancements* that buy back the depth-axis metrics (club path, attack angle,
thrust) — never the gate to real analysis. The plan ships **standalone user value at every
milestone** (M0 persistence → M1 monocular skeleton + IMU orientation metrics + banded score →
M2 single-camera metric calibration + monocular lift → M3 second-camera triangulation + club-IMU
enhancements → M4 smoothing/IK → M5 reference-swing scoring + feedback → M6 polish/validation).

*This design was produced by reading the actual codebase (Appendix A) and researching the domain
(Appendix B); the four core sections below are the design proper, and the Implementation Plan is the
sequenced build-out.*

## Architecture & Data Pipeline

### Design goals & non-goals

**Goals.** Turn a frozen `pinpoint::SwingWindow` (raw camera frames + 100 Hz `ImuSample` records + the 16-byte `shot_marker_v1`) into a metric, scored, coach-readable result that persists across app restarts — without violating the EventBuffer producer contract, the quaternions-only rule, or the existing `ShotAnalyzer::analyze(const SwingWindow&, const ShotAnalysisJob&)` worker-thread contract. The pipeline must degrade gracefully (full 3D when two calibrated cameras + IMUs are present, down to 2D angles-only when nothing is calibrated) and must remain a *pure const reader* of ring memory.

**Non-goals (v1).** No live/real-time biomechanics (this is post-shot only, on the QtConcurrent worker), no learned motion priors (deferred), no club-launch ball-flight modelling beyond geometry, and no new EventBuffer source (pose/ball stay re-derived offline, not written back to the ring).

### Layered model

All new code lives under `src/Analysis/` in namespace `pinpoint::analysis`. The pipeline is nine named layers; each is a stage the per-session analyzer composes:

| # | Layer name | Module dir | Responsibility |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | **Decode** (`FrameDecoder`) | `src/Analysis/decode/` | Zero-copy `cv::Mat` wrap + demosaic of each `payloadOf()` slot, reusing `SwingExporter`'s demosaic table (NV12/YUV420P/BGRA32/Bayer8). |
| 1 | **Detection** (`PoseRunner`, `ClubBallTracker`) | `src/Analysis/detect/` | Re-run pose (**ViTPose-L/H** body via the already-wired `PoseEstimatorViTPose`; its whole-body 133-kpt also supplies hands) + club/ball keypoints per decoded frame, per camera, via ONNX Runtime. Accuracy-first — the analyzer is offline; the live 60 Hz path keeps MoveNet/RTMPose. |
| 2 | **Reconstruction** (`Triangulator`) | `src/Analysis/recon/` | Confidence-weighted DLT (Eigen SVD) of matched 2D keypoints into metric 3D using injected camera calibration; single-view ray∩bone-sphere fallback. |
| 3 | **Fusion** (`ImuVisionFuser`) | `src/Analysis/fusion/` | Apply per-source anatomical transform `q_anat = A·q_raw·M`; fill occluded shaft/wrist segments from IMU orientation; Kabsch yaw alignment of IMU world → camera world. |
| 4 | **Cleanup** (`TrackSmoother`) | `src/Analysis/cleanup/` | Per-joint constant-acceleration Kalman + Rauch–Tung–Striebel backward smoother over the whole window (offline → future samples available). |
| 5 | **Skeleton** (`SkeletonSolver`) | `src/Analysis/skeleton/` | Weighted-LS IK over joint angles with fixed bone lengths + ROM box limits → the canonical `SkeletonTimeline` of per-bone quaternions. |
| 6 | **Metrics** (`MetricExtractor`) | `src/Analysis/metrics/` | Phase-anchored biomechanics: rotations, X-factor/stretch, kinematic sequence, wrist angles, tempo, sway/thrust/lift → `MetricSeries`. |
| 7 | **Scoring** (`SwingScorer`) | `src/Analysis/score/` | Tolerance-band clipped-z sub-scores + weighted **geometric** mean → `ScoreBreakdown`. |
| 8 | **Feedback** (`FaultRanker`) | `src/Analysis/feedback/` | Rule table keyed on (metric, phase, sign), ranked by points-lost → `Fault` list. |

A `PhaseSegmenter` (`src/Analysis/phase/`) is a cross-cutting helper used by layers 6–8, anchored on `job.impactUs`.

### Plugging into the existing interface

The four stub classes in `shot_analyzer.cpp` are replaced by real analyzers that all derive from a new `BiomechAnalyzer` base (in `src/Analysis/biomech_analyzer.h`) which owns the layer pipeline; `makeShotAnalyzer(sessionType)` dispatches to `SwingAnalyzer`/`WristAnalyzer`/`GrfAnalyzer`/`CoachAnalyzer`, each selecting which layers run and which metric/score/fault tables apply. `analyze()` keeps its exact signature, stays a const reader, and finishes all window reads before returning — `ShotProcessor::finishNowBlocking()` continues to join before window destruction.

**Extending the job.** `ShotAnalysisJob` is widened (still a UI-thread-resolved value type) with everything the worker cannot read itself:

```cpp
struct CameraCalib { Eigen::Matrix3d K; Eigen::VectorXd dist; Eigen::Quaterniond q_wc; Eigen::Vector3d t_wc; bool valid; };
struct ImuSegmentBinding { pinpoint::SourceId source; SegmentRole role; QQuaternion alignA, mountM; };
// added to ShotAnalysisJob:
std::vector<CameraCalib>        cameraCalib;     // parallel to cameraSources; valid=false ⇒ degrade
std::vector<ImuSegmentBinding>  imuBindings;     // resolves placement A/B/C → SegmentRole + anat transform
int   handedness = 0;  QString club;  QString athleteUuid;  QString swingDir;  bool cameraFixedInPlace = false;
```

`CameraCalib` is populated from new `AppSettings::cameraIntrinsics`/`cameraExtrinsics` maps (keyed on `cameraKey = description|serial`); `ImuSegmentBinding` resolves `AppSettings::imuPlacement` + the live `ImuInstance::alignA()/mountM()` snapshot. `swingDir` is where the single unified `swing.json` (raw manifest + inline analysis) is written at the join.

**Extending the result.** `ShotAnalysisResult` keeps `ok/score/metrics/tracePoints` (unchanged `ShotListModel::addShot` path — fully backward compatible) and gains an opaque-to-old-readers `std::shared_ptr<SwingAnalysis> detail`. `SwingAnalysis` carries the rich output (skeleton timeline, metric series, score breakdown, faults, phase timeline). `ShotProcessor::maybeJoin()` continues to call `addShot()` with the flat fields; a new optional role `analysisDetail` on `ShotListModel::Shot` holds the pointer for the detail UI. **Persistence:** there is **no separate `analysis.json`** — the analyzer's `SwingAnalysis` is folded **inline** into `swing.json` under an additive `"analysis"` object, written **once** at `ShotProcessor::maybeJoin()` (the GUI-thread barrier where both workers have completed). See *Persistence — unified `swing.json`* under Metrics & Scoring for the single-writer mechanism.

### Canonical intermediate data structures

```cpp
namespace pinpoint::analysis {

// Layer-0 master clock: all streams resampled onto camera-frame grid (or fixed 200 Hz).
struct TimelineSample { int64_t t_us; };                       // base; impact-relative via job.impactUs
using TimeGrid = std::vector<int64_t>;                         // ascending t_us, master timeline

enum class JointId { Pelvis, Spine, Neck, Head, LShoulder, /*…COCO+synth pelvis/neck…*/ Count };
enum class SegmentRole { Pelvis, Thorax, T12, LeadUpperArm, LeadForearm, LeadHand, TrailThigh, LeadThigh, Club };

struct SkeletonFrame {
    int64_t t_us;
    std::array<Eigen::Vector3d, (int)JointId::Count> joint;     // metric world position (m)
    std::array<float,           (int)JointId::Count> conf;      // 0..1, 0 ⇒ filled/missing
    std::array<QQuaternion, (int)SegmentRole::Count> segQuat;   // parent-local bone quaternion
};
struct SkeletonTimeline { std::vector<SkeletonFrame> frames; double boneLengthM[(int)SegmentRole::Count]; };

struct ClubSample { int64_t t_us; Eigen::Vector3d butt, mid, head; QQuaternion shaftQuat; float conf; };
struct BallSample { int64_t t_us; Eigen::Vector3d pos; bool present; };
struct ClubTrack { std::vector<ClubSample> samples; };
struct BallTrack { std::vector<BallSample> samples; };

struct MetricSeries { QString key; QString label; QString unit;            // machine-readable
                      std::vector<int64_t> t_us; std::vector<double> value; };
struct ScoredMetric { QString key; double value; double mu, sigma; double subScore;  // 0..100
                      QString band; /* green/yellow/red */ double weight; };
enum class Phase { Address, Takeaway, Top, Transition, Downswing, Impact, Release, Finish };
struct PhaseEvent { Phase phase; int64_t t_us; };

struct Fault { QString id, title, cause, drill; double pointsLost; Phase phase; };
struct ScoreBreakdown { int overall; QHash<QString,int> perRegion, perPhase; std::vector<ScoredMetric> metrics; };

struct SwingAnalysis {          // the rich detail behind ShotAnalysisResult::detail
    SkeletonTimeline skeleton; ClubTrack club; BallTrack ball;
    std::vector<MetricSeries> series; std::vector<PhaseEvent> phases;
    ScoreBreakdown score; std::vector<Fault> faults; int tier; // ReconstructionTier
};
} // namespace
```

All rotation is `QQuaternion`/`Eigen::Quaterniond`; Euler appears only at UI readout.

### Threading & performance

`analyze()` already runs on a QtConcurrent worker concurrently with `SwingExporter::run()` over the same frozen window. Heavy ONNX inference (layer 1) reuses the existing EP cascade (CoreML→CUDA→DirectML→CPU) but with `IntraOpNumThreads(1)` to avoid contending with the exporter's x264 encode; sessions are constructed per-`analyze()` call (the factory is per-shot). **Memory:** decode is zero-copy `cv::Mat` views over ring slots; only per-frame keypoint arrays and the `SkeletonTimeline` are heap-allocated (~5 s × ~120 fps × small structs ≈ a few MB). **Latency budget** for a 5 s window on a GPU EP: decode+pose dominate (~2 detector passes × 1–2 cameras × ~300 frames). Target ≈ 2–4 s wall on GPU, ≤ 10 s CPU; the shot still lands on the carousel regardless (degrade to `ok=false` → score 0, no replay), so latency never blocks the UI.

### Reconstruction tiers (revised)

The pipeline does **not** treat two cameras as the road to "real" analysis and one camera
as a degraded fallback. The common owner has **one face-on camera + sparse IMUs**, and that
configuration is a **first-class, fully-developed path** — the existing Wrist session already
lives there (`requiredCameras == 1`). Capability is the product of **two independent axes**,
not one ladder:

- **Camera axis** — `C0` no calibrated camera (2D image plane only) · `C1` **one** calibrated
  face-on camera (intrinsics + a single ground-plane `solvePnP` → metric world frame + scale,
  in-plane metric translations, monocular metric lift) · `C2` a second (down-the-line) camera
  for triangulated depth + occlusion redundancy.
- **IMU axis** — `I0` none · `I1` sparse (1–3 of pelvis / thorax / lead-wrist / lead-forearm)
  → absolute segment orientation · `I2` adds a future **club-shaft IMU** → club orientation,
  speed and shaft lean.

The key geometric fact the old tiering under-weighted: a **face-on camera images the frontal
plane** (lab `X` = target line and `Z` = vertical are *in-plane* and strongly observed), while
the down-the-line direction (lab `Y`, toward/away from ball) lies **along the optical axis** —
the worst depth axis, where monocular error is ~2–3× the in-plane error. Orthogonally, every
**segment-orientation** metric (X-factor, wrist flex/RUD, forearm pronation, shaft lean, body
kinematic-sequence timing) comes from the **IMU's absolute gravity-referenced quaternion** and
is **camera-count-independent** — full fidelity on one camera or two. So the second camera buys
back exactly the depth-axis quantities and occlusion robustness, and *nothing else*.

`enum ReconstructionTier` (chosen at job-build time from `cameraCalib[].valid` count + resolved
`imuBindings`):

1. **`Angles2D`** *(C0/C1, I0)* — no IMU. Image-plane angle series only: lead-arm flexion, tempo,
   2D turn proxies, and frontal-plane translations *once* `C1` calibration exists. The genuinely
   reduced corner — this is where the old "Angles2D" belongs, **not** single-cam+IMU.
2. **`Mono3D+IMU`** *(C1, I1)* — **the flagship single-camera tier.** One calibrated face-on
   camera (ground-plane scale + monocular lift via `MonoLift`/`MotionBERT`) **fused** with sparse
   IMUs (`ImuVisionFuser`). Delivers a *complete, validated coaching product*: **all** orientation
   metrics at full fidelity from the IMU (X-factor & stretch, wrist FE/RUD, forearm pronation,
   body kinematic sequence, pelvis/thorax turn), **plus** frontal-plane translations (sway, lift,
   secondary tilt, side-bend) and lead-arm flexion / tempo from the camera + ground plane. The IMU
   supplies the toward/away orientation the camera cannot see (von-Marcard bone-direction
   constraint), resolving the monocular depth/flip ambiguity for instrumented segments and
   reconstructing them straight through occlusion. **This is not a degraded `Full3D`** — it
   reproduces the SPI AUC-0.97 pelvic/torso-velocity separator and the HackMotion wrist bands,
   neither of which needs a second camera.
3. **`Stereo3D`** *(C2, I1+)* — the second (down-the-line) camera added as an **accuracy /
   occlusion enhancement**. Confidence-weighted DLT (`Triangulator`) recovers exactly the
   depth-axis metrics `C1` genuinely cannot do (`pelvisThrust`, `clubPath`, `attackAngle`,
   `swingPlane` azimuth) and **raises confidence** on the `Mono3D+IMU` metrics rather than making
   them appear for the first time. Positioned as *"better club delivery + fewer occlusions"*,
   never as "the real tier".
4. **`ClubInstrumented`** *(any C, I2)* — a future shaft/clubface IMU. An **orthogonal** upgrade
   to the second camera: unlocks reliable `clubheadSpeed` (`v_grip + ω×r`), shaft lean, a
   `faceAngle` proxy, and the club link of the kinematic sequence — **without** a second camera.
   A one-camera owner reaches club metrics by adding a *sensor*, not a *camera*.

`MonoLift` is therefore not a "fallback inside `Full3D`" but the **reconstruction layer of the
`Mono3D+IMU` tier**: when a view is absent or occluded, `Triangulator` swaps DLT for the
`MonoLift`/`MotionBERT` lifter, then `ImuVisionFuser` anchors it. Each metric additionally carries
its **own** provenance/confidence (see the catalog reframe), so degradation is data-driven per
metric — never a binary camera gate — and the UI prompts the *right* upgrade ("add a down-the-line
camera for club path" vs. "add a club sensor for clubhead speed").

### Per-session-type behavior

All four analyzers share layers 0–5; they differ in metric tables, scoring weights, and which sources matter:

- **SwingAnalyzer (0):** full body 3D. Pelvis/thorax rotation + velocity, **X-factor & X-factor-stretch**, kinematic-sequence efficiency, sway/thrust/lift, side-bend, tempo; club track drives swing-plane (SVD) and hand-path attack/path proxies. Heaviest tier.
- **WristAnalyzer (1):** single face-on camera + lead-wrist/hand IMU dominant. Lead-wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation, forearm pronation/supination from `q_forearm⁻¹·q_hand` swing-twist; one-sided scoring bands (cupping penalized). Runs the `Mono3D+IMU` tier with ViTPose-wholebody hand keypoints (channels 91–132) as a vision cross-check.
- **GrfAnalyzer (2):** lead/trail-thigh + lumbar IMUs + cameras; weight-shift/sway and ground-contact timing from pelvis translation and feet keypoints. **No force-plate source exists** — GRF is estimated kinematically and clearly labelled as such until a force source is added.
- **CoachAnalyzer (3):** thorax/lumbar/T12 same as Swing but tuned weights and a DTW shape-similarity sub-score against a stored reference swing for over-the-top/casting path faults; emphasizes ranked faults over a single number.

The factory dispatch, `analyze()` signature, `ShotAnalysisJob`/`ShotAnalysisResult` flow into `addShot()`, and the frozen-window contract are all unchanged — the biomechanics is purely additive behind the existing seam.

## Algorithms

This section specifies the per-layer algorithms behind the `BiomechAnalyzer` pipeline. Layer names (`FrameDecoder`, `PoseRunner`, `Triangulator`, `ImuVisionFuser`, `TrackSmoother`, `SkeletonSolver`, `MetricExtractor`, `SwingScorer`, `FaultRanker`, `PhaseSegmenter`) refer to the architecture table. Each layer notes its MVP vs. deferred status.

### 0. Single-camera calibration (`SkeletonSolver` world frame, revised Algorithms §0)

Calibration is **not** a stereo prerequisite. It splits into four independent items, the first
two of which already give a complete metric `Mono3D+IMU` tier on **one** camera. **Metric scale
and a metric world frame are recoverable from a single camera** — a second camera is *not*
required for either.

**(a) Per-camera intrinsics (ChArUco) — valuable even alone.** Print a ChArUco board (e.g. 7×10
squares; measure the printed square with calipers — never trust the print scale). Build
`cv::aruco::CharucoBoard(Size(sx,sy), squareLenM, markerLenM, dict)` + `cv::aruco::CharucoDetector`
(OpenCV ≥ 4.7 unified API — legacy `calibrateCameraCharuco` is removed). Per view:
`detector.detectBoard(img, corners, ids)` → `board.matchImagePoints(...)`; accumulate 15–30 views
spanning all four image corners; `cv::calibrateCamera(...)`. **Gate RMS < 0.5 px**, surface it in
the wizard's calibration-status column (the IMU mount-gate pattern), re-shoot otherwise. Output
`K`, `dist`. With a **known focal length** alone, a metric-scale monocular lifter (MeTRAbs-style)
can already emit true-millimetre root-relative pose — so intrinsics are useful on their own,
before any extrinsic.

**(b) Single-camera ground-plane extrinsic → metric world frame + scale (one frame, ONE camera).**
This is **the** step that unlocks metric monocular 3D — **not** a second camera. Lay one large
ChArUco flat at the hitting spot, grab **one** frame, and run
`cv::solvePnP(boardObj_in_metres, imgPts, K, dist, rvec, tvec, SOLVEPNP_IPPE)` (IPPE exploits
planarity). The **board frame is the world frame**, so `world→camera = T(rvec,tvec)` directly and
`P = K[R|t]`. Because the object points are in **metres**, `t` is already metric — **scale and a
gravity-consistent world orientation are fixed simultaneously, with no essential-matrix scale
ambiguity**, from a single view. Bake a fixed rigid offset `T_world←board` to place the origin at
the tee with `+X` = target line, `+Z` = up. Tie re-runs to the existing `cameraFixedInPlace` flag.
QA gate: measure a wand of known length to within ~0.5 %. Caveat: a single planar board fixes the
*world frame* well but is weak **out-of-plane**, so it does *not* by itself constrain the golfer's
depth motion — that is recovered by the IMU/temporal/ground-contact terms in layers 3–4, not by
the board. (Optionally add a second board at a known height for a stronger static out-of-plane
constraint before any BA polish.)

**(c) No-board scale prior (graceful fallback).** When the user has not run the board capture (a
"one phone, no setup" capture), recover absolute scale by constraining back-projected **bone
lengths** to subject-specific or population-average values (Pavlakos-style least-squares on root
depth in `SkeletonSolver`), or by a **subject-height** field in the wizard. This keeps a *scaled*
skeleton so tempo / turn / side-bend / sway / lift still work, but feeds a **lower confidence**
than the board-calibrated metric frame and degrades when limbs foreshorten toward the camera
(again the optical-axis problem). **Gate cm-unit metrics on having a real scale source** — without
a board *or* a height/bone prior a single camera yields only an *unscaled* skeleton, so even
sway/lift are meaningless.

**(d) Second-camera extrinsic for triangulation (optional `Stereo3D` enhancement).** When a
down-the-line camera is present and **both** are already intrinsically calibrated by (a), the
relative pose is *cheap*: solve each camera's extrinsic from the **same** shared ground-plane
board via per-camera `cv::solvePnP(SOLVEPNP_IPPE)` composed through the common board frame
(board = world). Do **not** use `cv::stereoCalibrate`'s rectification path — it is numerically
degenerate at the ~90° DTL/face-on convergence. This yields `P_i = K_i[R_i|t_i]` for both
cameras for the confidence-weighted DLT in `Triangulator`. **This step is an enhancement, not a
gate:** every `Mono3D+IMU` metric is already produced without it; it adds only the depth-axis
metrics and occlusion redundancy.

**Extrinsic polish (deferred, Ceres).** One small bundle adjustment over the 12 (or 6, single-cam)
extrinsic DOF against all static board corners, intrinsics + 3D board points held constant
(`SetParameterBlockConstant`), `AutoDiffCostFunction<ReprojErr,2,6,3>` mirroring
`SnavelyReprojectionError`, `CauchyLoss`, `DENSE_SCHUR` + LM. MVP ships with raw `solvePnP`.

**Storage/UX.** `AppSettings::cameraIntrinsics` / `cameraExtrinsics` `QVariantMap`s keyed on
`cameraKey = description|serial` (single-AppSettings-instance rule), a genuine RMS-gated
`cameraCalibrated` flag on `CameraInstance`, and an optional `subjectHeightM` / per-subject
bone-length table for (c). The `CameraCalibrationFlow.qml` stub becomes capture → detect →
solve → reproj-gate → persist, mirroring `ImuCalibrationFlow`. On the UI thread,
`ShotProcessor::startAnalysis` reads these into `job.cameraCalib[]`; **one** valid calib selects
`Mono3D+IMU`, two select `Stereo3D`, none (with a height/bone prior) still yields a scaled
`Angles2D`/`Mono3D+IMU`.

### 1. Per-frame 2D detection (`PoseRunner`, `ClubBallTracker`, layer 1)

All models stay behind `PoseEstimatorBase`-style subclasses reusing the existing ORT EP cascade (CoreML→CUDA→DirectML→CPU), the pimpl `OrtState`, and `IntraOpNumThreads(1)` (to avoid contending with the exporter's x264 encode). Every subclass must honor the throttle-balance contract on all paths (the offline path bypasses `FrameThrottle`, but keep the `estimationDone()` discipline if reused live). All weights are Apache/MIT/BSD — **explicitly reject AGPL Ultralytics YOLO and CC-BY-NC GolfDB/SwingNet weights**.

**Body (MVP): ViTPose-L** (or **ViTPose-H** for maximum accuracy), top-down — already implemented as `PoseEstimatorViTPose` (currently the ViTPose-B-wholebody model; upgrade the variant). **Accuracy over speed by design:** the analyzer runs offline on a frozen window with a generous latency budget, so prefer ViTPose-L/H (~78–79 AP) over the speed-tier RTMPose-m (~75–76 AP); RTMPose/MoveNet stay on the live 60 Hz path only. A golfer is frame-stable, so run one person box (RTMDet-nano or reuse `PersonSegmenter`) at clip start and reuse it across the window; affine-warp the crop with a proper **letterbox** (*not* MoveNet's distorting square resize, which biases joint geometry), run ORT, and decode the heatmaps (argmax + sub-pixel/DARK refine) via the existing ViTPose decode path. Fill the 17-slot `PoseResult` (normalized y/x/score) unchanged. Favour the higher 384×288 input for motion-blurred downswing frames.

**Hands/wrist (camera cross-check, optional):** no separate model — the **same ViTPose-wholebody** network already emits 133 keypoints; channels 91–132 are the 21 lead-hand landmarks, currently discarded at `pose_estimator_vitpose.cpp:241`. Expose them via **new sibling result structs** with `Q_DECLARE_METATYPE` (never overload the 17-slot `PoseResult` — `BodyPoseAdapter` reads it by index) to get a camera-side hand cross-check for free. The forearm vector (elbow→wrist) vs hand vector (wrist→middle-MCP) yields a wrist-hinge sanity check — but for the Wrist session the IMU is authoritative, so this is only a cross-check, never the source.

**Club/ball (deferred):** a small custom 3–4-point shaft/clubhead keypoint model (RTMPose-tiny head retrained on self-captured, license-clean frames) seeded/validated by classical `cv::HoughLinesP`/LSD shaft-line fitting in a wrist-anchored ROI (robust through motion blur). Ball: `cv::HoughCircles`/blob on the teed-ball ROI. Until trained, club metrics are emitted as lead-hand-path approximations and clearly labelled.

### 2. 3D reconstruction (`Triangulator`, layer 2)

**Multi-view DLT — the `Stereo3D` accuracy enhancement (M3, only when a 2nd calibrated camera is present).** Per joint per master-grid instant: `cv::undistortPoints(pts_i, norm_i, K_i, dist_i)` to normalized rays, then build the confidence-weighted homogeneous system `A·X=0`. Each view `c` contributes two rows `[x_c·P_c.row(2) − P_c.row(0)]` and `[y_c·P_c.row(2) − P_c.row(1)]`, each **scaled by `sqrt(conf_c)`** (sqrt because the residual is squared — this gives the 22.6 vs 27.4 mm MPJPE edge of weighted DLT over RANSAC). Solve with `Eigen::JacobiSVD`/`BDCSVD`, take the smallest right-singular vector, dehomogenize. At ~90° convergence DLT is near-optimal, so add only **one** Gauss-Newton reprojection-refinement step (2×2 normal equations per point); skip Hartley–Sturm.

**Outlier gate.** With >2 views, triangulate, reproject, drop any view exceeding a pixel threshold, re-triangulate. Mirror swaps (respect the `isMirrored` flag in `P_i`) and left/right limb swaps surface as gross reprojection outliers and **must be rejected before smoothing**. A joint is `measured` only if both confidences exceed a floor **and** the ray-intersection angle lies in [20°,160°]; otherwise mark `missing` (set `conf=0`) — never fabricate from one confident view plus a guess.

**Monocular metric lift — the primary `Mono3D+IMU` reconstruction path (`MonoLift`, M2).** This is the **common single-camera case**, not a fallback: whenever fewer than two calibrated views are present (one face-on camera, or one view occluded), reconstruction uses MotionBERT (self-exported ONNX, fixed 243- or 81-frame clip, opset 17). Requires COCO-17→H36M-17 remap (synthesize pelvis=mid-hip, neck=mid-shoulder), per-clip 2D normalization, and a sliding buffer. Depth-dependent metrics get lower confidence. Pin to GPU EP.

### 3. IMU–camera fusion (`ImuVisionFuser`, layer 3)

**Sensor-to-segment anatomical transform.** The frozen `ImuSample` carries the **raw fused sensor-body** quaternion (accel/gyro are display-remapped, the quaternion is not). Apply the per-source anatomical transform resolved into `job.imuBindings[]`: `q_anat = A · q_raw · M` (`A=alignA`, `M=mountM` snapshotted from the live `ImuInstance` on the UI thread — they are session-lifetime and never reach the ring). `SegmentRole` comes from `AppSettings::imuPlacement[deviceId]` ('A'/'B'/'C') mapped through the session-type slot labels.

**Temporal alignment (MVP, critical).** Camera and IMU share `steady_clock` µs but are software-timestamped with multi-ms jitter; at 45 m/s clubhead 1 ms = 45 mm. Estimate a sub-frame per-stream offset by **cross-correlating IMU angular-velocity magnitude against the triangulated clubhead (or wrist) speed**, picking the fractional-frame shift that minimizes the lag-1 cross-correlation residual. Anchor everything on `job.impactUs` (the exact backdated marker). A 1-frame downswing error wrecks fusion — this step is non-optional.

**Quaternion injection.** For occluded shaft/wrist/forearm segments, place the child joint geometrically: `child = parent + L · (R_anat · segmentAxis)` — the IMU reconstructs the club and lead arm **through** full occlusion and motion blur, exactly where 2D detectors fail. Compose only via `QQuaternion`/slerp; never round-trip through Euler. Yaw drift of the 6-axis filter is removed per-shot by a Kabsch SVD alignment `R_GW` of IMU world to camera world over a still window (gravity is shared, so only yaw is free); re-zero heading-dependent metrics (X-factor, axial rotation) per shot — inclination metrics (shaft lean) are drift-free and need no re-zero.

**Tightly-coupled refinement (deferred).** A post-shot Ceres window optimizer over joint angles: reprojection + von Marcard bone-direction (the IMU segment axis must agree with the camera bone direction) + accel + smoothness residuals (~23 mm MPJPE). MVP fuses IMU as direct segment-orientation placement in layer 5's IK rather than a separate optimizer.

### 4. Temporal cleanup (`TrackSmoother`, layer 4)

**Resample to one timeline (layer 0/4 boundary).** Choose camera-frame timestamps (or a fixed 200 Hz grid) as master. **SLERP** IMU quaternions (`Eigen::Quaterniond::slerp` / `QQuaternion::slerp`, never lerp Euler) and **Catmull-Rom cubic-spline** positions/2D-keypoints between bracketing samples; linear interpolation only for scalar confidence channels.

**Kalman + RTS (MVP).** Per joint and per club point, a 9-state constant-acceleration linear KF (state `[p,v,a]`, white-noise-jerk process model, `H` selects position). Update on `measured`/IMU-filled frames with `R ∝ 1/conf`; **predict-only (skip the update)** on still-missing frames — never feed a zero or last-value as a fake measurement. Because each shot is a finished offline window, run the **Rauch–Tung–Striebel backward smoother** across the whole window (`C_k = P_k Fᵀ P_{k+1|k}⁻¹`; `x_k^s = x_k + C_k(x_{k+1}^s − x_{k+1|k})`) — strictly better than forward-only, removing lag/overshoot at impact. Tune jerk PSD **per joint**: high for hands/clubhead, low for torso (a single global value either lags the clubhead or jitters the torso). Enforce quaternion sign-continuity (`flip if dot(q_prev,q)<0`) before any differentiation.

**Gap fill order.** Before smoothing: (1) single-view ray ∩ bone-length sphere on the parent; (2) IMU-segment placement (layer 3); (3) KF coast. Learned motion priors (conv-autoencoder/ReMP) are **deferred** — only worth it for >0.3 s simultaneous all-sensor loss, rare on a 2-cam + shaft-IMU rig.

### 5. Skeleton / IK (`SkeletonSolver`, layer 5)

Bone lengths are **fixed per-subject constants**, calibrated once from a clean address frame — never re-estimated per frame. Solve weighted-LS IK over joint angles `q` minimizing `Σ wᵢ‖x_exp,ᵢ − x_model,ᵢ(q)‖²` with bone lengths baked into the forward-kinematic model and per-DOF box ROM limits; occluded joints get `wᵢ=0`. Solve via Ceres `AutoDiff` over `q` with `SetParameterLowerBound/UpperBound` for ROM, or Eigen Gauss-Newton for MVP. This guarantees constant bone lengths, pulls bad joints onto the anatomical manifold, and **emits per-bone `QQuaternion`s straight into the existing BodyPoseAdapter/BodyVizView chain** — the `SkeletonTimeline`. Biomechanical joint-limit priors (Akhter-Black conditioned limits) are a deferred penalty/reject layer; simple per-DOF box clamps ship in MVP.

### 6. Swing-phase segmentation (`PhaseSegmenter`, cross-cutting, MVP)

A hybrid signal detector over the `SkeletonTimeline` + IMU streams. **Impact** is the hard anchor (`job.impactUs`, IMU accel spike, ball-leaves-pixel — intersect for the frame). **Top/transition** = per-segment axial angular-velocity zero-crossing (pelvis crosses first — gives sequence order). **Address** = sustained angular-velocity minimum before motion onset (re-anchor the reference frame here, **not** frame 0). **Takeaway** = first rise above a noise threshold; **finish** = decay back toward zero. Typical durations gate the detectors (backswing ~1.16 s, downswing ~0.32 s, follow-through ~0.67 s). Output `std::vector<PhaseEvent>`. A learned GolfDB/SwingNet-style ONNX event detector (for the geometric toe-up/parallel events) is **deferred**; the IMU heuristic is the always-available fallback. Differentiate quaternions for angular speed (`ω ≈ 2·log(q_t⁻¹·q_{t+1})/dt`) and **Butterworth/Savitzky-Golay filter before peak-finding** — raw differentiated peaks make the kinematic-sequence order noise-dependent.

The downstream `MetricExtractor`/`SwingScorer`/`FaultRanker` (layers 6–8) consume these phase-anchored timelines; their algorithms (swing-twist axial decomposition, tolerance-band clipped-z sub-scores, weighted geometric aggregation, points-lost fault ranking) are detailed in the Metrics and Scoring sections.

## Metrics & Scoring

This section specifies the biomechanical metric catalog produced by `MetricExtractor` (layer 6) and the scoring/feedback model produced by `SwingScorer` (layer 7) and `FaultRanker` (layer 8). Every metric is computed at a phase event resolved by `PhaseSegmenter` and emitted as a `MetricSeries` (full time history) plus a single scalar at its scoring phase; the scalar feeds a `ScoredMetric`. All rotations stay `QQuaternion`/`Eigen::Quaterniond`; the angle extractions below convert to degrees only at the readout (the formulae use swing-twist decomposition and horizontal-projection `atan2`, never stored Euler intermediates).

### A) Metric catalog

Notation: `R_seg` = a segment's right-handed anatomical frame (built per the architecture's `SkeletonFrame.segQuat`); `q_seg` its quaternion; lab frame X = target line, Y = down-the-line/away-from-ball, Z = up (Cheetham convention). `twist(q, axis)` = swing-twist axial component of `q` about `axis`. `turn(e_ml)` = `atan2(dot(e_ml_h, Y), dot(e_ml_h, X))` of the segment medio-lateral axis projected to horizontal, **relative to its Address value**. "Input" states the data source. Per-metric **single-camera viability and the minimum capability** that yields each metric at full fidelity are in the companion *"Single-camera (face-on) viability"* table immediately below — not a column here, because viability is driven by camera *count* × IMU *placement*, not a single linear tier.

| Metric (key) | Definition & formula | Input | Phase | Unit | Pro / ideal range (source) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pelvisRotation` | Axial pelvis turn vs address: `turn(e_ml_pelvis)`. | fused / IMU pelvis | Top, Impact | deg | Top ~45; Impact ~35–45 open (PMC9227529) |
| `thoraxRotation` | Axial thorax turn vs address: `turn(e_ml_thorax)`. | fused / IMU thorax | Top, Impact | deg | Top ~90 (shoulders) (PMC9227529) |
| `xFactor` | Thorax-minus-pelvis axial separation: `turn(e_ml_thorax) − turn(e_ml_pelvis)`, or `twist(q_pelvis⁻¹·q_thorax, pelvis_up)`. Label the method (acromion ≈2× spine). | fused / IMU | Top | deg | Top ~40–42 (TPI); ~48–60 shoulder-vs-pelvis (PMC9227529) |
| `xFactorStretch` | `max(xFactor over early downswing) − xFactor(Top)`. The stretch-shorten power signal — better speed predictor than static X-factor. | fused / IMU | Transition→early downswing | deg | ~5; skilled +19% vs +13% (Cheetham X-Factor Stretch) |
| `hipInternalRotation` | True hip-joint rotation: thigh axial vs pelvis, `twist(q_pelvis⁻¹·q_thigh, thigh_long)`, per side. | fused 3D | Top, Impact | deg | lead ~50 / trail ~40 amplitude (PMC9227529) |
| `leadWristFlexExt` | Lead hand flexion(+)/extension(−) vs forearm: Cardan component 1 of `q_forearm⁻¹·q_hand` about hand medio-lateral axis. Measured **relative to Address**. | **IMU (lead wrist/hand)** | Top, Impact | deg | Impact 15–30 more flexed than address; cupping at top a fault (HackMotion) |
| `leadWristRadUln` | Radial(+)/ulnar(−) deviation: Cardan component 2 of `q_forearm⁻¹·q_hand` about dorsal-palmar axis. | **IMU (lead wrist/hand)** | Top, Impact | deg | sets/holds lag; large ulnar at top normal (HackMotion) |
| `forearmPronation` | Lead-forearm pronation(+)/supination(−): `twist(q_upperarm⁻¹·q_forearm, elbow→wrist)`. | **IMU / fused** | Top→Impact | deg | rolls toward square through impact (PMC9227529) |
| `spineForwardBend` | Posture/forward bend: Cardan component 1 (flex/ext) of thorax(-rel-pelvis), fixed XYZ sequence. | camera-3D / fused | Address, Impact | deg | retained ~30–40 (irons) from address (PMC9227529) |
| `spineSideBend` | Lateral flexion (trail-side bend): Cardan component 2 of thorax(-rel-pelvis). | camera-3D / fused | Impact | deg | thorax ~32 / pelvis ~10 at driver impact (Cheetham/TPI) |
| `secondaryAxisTilt` | Spine lean away from target: angle of mid-hip→mid-shoulder vector from vertical in the frontal plane. | camera-3D | Impact | deg | ~20–25 at impact; ~6–8 at address (Cheetham) |
| `pelvisSway` | Lateral pelvis-origin displacement along X vs address: `dot(pelvis(t)−pelvis(addr), X)`. | **camera-3D only** | Backswing, Impact | cm | away in backswing, toward target downswing (Cheetham 6DOF) |
| `pelvisThrust` | Toward-ball displacement along Y; positive too early = early-extension fault. | **camera-3D only** | Downswing, Impact | cm | minimal toward-ball until late (Cheetham) |
| `pelvisLift` | Vertical pelvis displacement along Z vs address. | **camera-3D only** | Impact | cm | small controlled rise (Cheetham) |
| `kinematicSequence` | Peak axial angular-speed **order, timing gaps, magnitudes** for pelvis→thorax→lead-arm→club, from `ω = 2·log(qₜ⁻¹·qₜ₊₁)/dt` (SG/Butterworth smoothed, sign-continuity enforced). | fused (IMU body + club track) | Transition→Impact | deg/s, ms, ordinal | pelvis ~480, thorax ~605, lead-arm ~1310, club higher; transition ~50 ms; proximal-to-distal, only club accelerates through impact (TPI; PMC9227529) |
| `leadArmFlexion` | Elbow angle: `acos(dot(û_upper, û_fore))` from shoulder/elbow/wrist. **Most reliable pose-only metric** (all three joints in COCO-17). | camera-3D / 2D | Top, Impact | deg | near-straight (~165–180) through impact (PMC9227529) |
| `swingPlane` | Best-fit plane of clubhead (or lead-hand proxy) trajectory, knee-to-knee downswing: normal = smallest right-singular vector (JacobiSVD); report tilt vs ground + azimuth. | camera-3D club / hand-path proxy | Downswing | deg | tilt/azimuth per club; label hand-path if no club (Frontiers 2026; TrackMan) |
| `clubheadSpeed` | `‖v_clubhead‖` at impact, central difference of clubhead 3D position; or `v_grip + ω×r` from grip+IMU. | camera-3D club / IMU+ZUPT | Impact | mph | Driver ~113; 7-iron ~89 (TrackMan 2024) |
| `clubPath` | Horizontal angle of `v_clubhead` vs target line: `atan2(v·Y, v·X)`; +in-to-out / −out-to-in. Hand-path **proxy** if no club. | camera-3D club | Impact | deg | near 0 ± a few (TrackMan) |
| `attackAngle` | Vertical angle of `v_clubhead`: `atan2(v·Z, ‖v_horiz‖)`. | camera-3D club / hand proxy | Impact | deg | Driver −1.3 (some +3..+5); 7-iron −4.5 (TrackMan 2024) |
| `faceAngle` | Horizontal angle of clubface normal vs target line; needs club tracking or **lead-forearm+wrist proxy**. | camera-3D club / IMU proxy | Impact | deg | small open/closed; gates ball start (TrackMan) |
| `tempoBackswing` | Address→Top duration. | any (phase events) | — | s | ~0.75–0.85 (TPI 0.847±0.111) |
| `tempoRatio` | `tempoBackswing / downswingTime` (Top→Impact). | any (phase events) | — | ratio | ~3:1 (tour 2.2–3.0:1) |

\* Wrist flex/ext is **only trustworthy from the IMU** — COCO-17 lacks knuckle/thumb keypoints, so even with two cameras the camera term is a weak cross-check (ViTPose-wholebody hand keypoints) and the IMU quaternion is authoritative. † `faceAngle` is gated behind club tracking; until then it is suppressed or exposed as a forearm+wrist proxy clearly labelled `estimated`.

#### Single-camera (face-on) viability — per-metric reframe

The catalog's old single **Tier** column implied most metrics need two cameras. They do not.
Each metric now carries **`minCameras`** (`0` = IMU-delivered, camera-count-independent · `1` =
single face-on camera viable · `2` = genuinely needs the depth axis) and a viability verdict for
the common **1 face-on camera + sparse IMU** owner. Three groups fall out:

- **Camera-independent (IMU-delivered, `minCameras 0`)** — relative segment orientations. Full
  fidelity on one camera *or two*; the second camera adds nothing.
- **Strong frontal-plane monocular (`minCameras 1`)** — in-plane translations and projected
  angles a face-on camera sees in focus; the second camera adds only minor robustness.
- **Depth-axis-limited (`minCameras 2`, or a club device)** — club path / attack / thrust / face
  live along the **optical axis** (toward/away from ball), the one direction a lone face-on camera
  cannot resolve; these **must be confidence-flagged or suppressed**, never shown as a confident
  number on one camera.

| Metric (key) | single-cam(face-on)+IMU | What delivers it | 2nd camera (DTL) adds | minCam |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pelvisRotation` | good¹ | **IMU** pelvis axial turn vs address | nothing (IMU is authoritative) | 0 |
| `thoraxRotation` | good | **IMU** thorax axial turn vs address | low-conf cross-check only | 0 |
| `xFactor` | **full** | **IMU pair** `twist(q_pelvis⁻¹·q_thorax, up)` | nothing | 0 |
| `xFactorStretch` | **full** | **IMU pair** time series (vision is *worse* here) | nothing | 0 |
| `hipInternalRotation` | limited² | **IMU** thigh-vs-pelvis twist (needs thigh IMU) | not recovered by camera count | 0 |
| `leadWristFlexExt` | **full** | **IMU** Cardan-1 of `q_forearm⁻¹·q_hand` | ~nothing (no hand kpts in COCO-17) | 0 |
| `leadWristRadUln` | **full** | **IMU** Cardan-2 of `q_forearm⁻¹·q_hand` | ~nothing | 0 |
| `forearmPronation` | full³ | **IMU** `twist(q_upper⁻¹·q_fore, elbow→wrist)` | nothing (axial roll, not visual) | 0 |
| `spineForwardBend` | good⁴ | **IMU** thorax-rel-pelvis flex (drift-free incl.) | DTL is the natural sagittal view | 0/2 |
| `spineSideBend` | **good** | camera 2D **and** IMU incl. (frontal lean) | marginal accuracy | 1 |
| `secondaryAxisTilt` | **good** | camera 2D frontal-plane vector vs vertical | marginal robustness | 1 |
| `pelvisSway` | **good** | camera + ground-plane (lateral `X`, in-plane) | disambiguates apparent-vs-depth motion | 1 |
| `pelvisThrust` | **limited** | toward-ball `Y` = optical axis (weak) | **this is the unlock** — DTL sees it in-plane | 2 |
| `pelvisLift` | **good** | camera + ground-plane (vertical `Z`, in-plane) | robustness only | 1 |
| `kinematicSequence` | **full (body)** | **IMU** per-segment peak `‖ω‖` order/timing | only the **club link** improves | 0 |
| `leadArmFlexion` | **full** | camera 2D elbow angle (all 3 joints in COCO-17) | sharpens when arm swings into optical axis | 1 |
| `swingPlane` | limited | 2D hand-path proxy only | DTL is the classic swing-plane view | 2 |
| `clubheadSpeed` | limited | in-plane 2D × ground-plane, or `v_grip+ω×r` | adds depth component | 2 |
| `clubPath` | **none** | discriminating axis is `v·Y` = optical axis | **canonical DTL metric** | 2 |
| `attackAngle` | limited⁵ | `Z` (in-plane) vs horizontal ratio | DTL makes it fully in-plane | 2 |
| `faceAngle` | none⁶ | IMU forearm+wrist *proxy* only (labelled est.) | needs a **club device**, not a camera | (club) |
| `tempoBackswing` | **full** | phase events (any source) + impact marker | nothing | 0 |
| `tempoRatio` | **full** | phase events + impact marker (IMU sharpens) | nothing | 0 |

¹ **good** assumes a real **pelvis** IMU. Today's Swing/Coach slots are thorax/lumbar/T12 with
**no pelvis mount** — fixing the slot map to a clean pelvis+thorax pair (M3) is the actual unlock
for `pelvisRotation`/`xFactor`, *not* a second camera. Without a pelvis IMU this degrades to a
weak 2D turn proxy (`minCameras 1`, low confidence).
² Instrumentation gate (needs a thigh IMU), **not** a camera gate — femoral axial rotation is hard
even with stereo + pose-only; do not let this metric argue for a second camera.
³ Needs an upper-arm/forearm reference; with a single combined lead-wrist module, pronation is
approximated and confidence-lowered.
⁴ `good` with a thorax+pelvis IMU pair (gravity-observable inclination, drift-free, **no** yaw
re-zero); pose-only single-cam it is `limited` (sagittal = optical axis).
⁵ Less severe than `clubPath` because the informative axis (`Z`) is in-plane; still gated on a
club detector and biased by the unknown depth component — flag confidence.
⁶ A true measurement needs club/clubface tracking. The IMU forearm+wrist **proxy** is
camera-count-independent and `estimated`-labelled; this metric argues for a **club device**, never
a second camera.

> **Quantitative rationale.** For a face-on camera the optical axis is the toward/away (`+Y`)
> direction; monocular depth error along it is ~2–3× the in-plane error (clinical ~72–122 mm
> in-plane vs ~146–249 mm with depth; MuPoTS absolute A-MPJPE ~248 mm even for *metric-scale*
> lifters). Therefore `attackAngle = atan2(Vy, √(Vx²+Vz²))` and `clubPath = atan2(Vx, Vy)` are
> computed almost entirely from the camera's **worst** axis — they are `minCameras 2` and must be
> suppressed or flagged on a lone face-on view. Conversely the IMU measures `‖ω‖` and gravity-
> referenced inclination *natively*, so the kinematic sequence and all tilt/side-bend/X-factor
> metrics are **more** reliable from the IMU than from any single-camera lift (validated: trunk/
> pelvis rotation ICC ≈ 1.0, X-factor ICC 0.94, mean error ~1° vs optical mocap, Sensors 2023).

**Revised MVP scope — what a 1 face-on camera + IMU user gets.** The single-camera + sparse-IMU
owner is a **first-class MVP target**, not a degraded one. **At MVP, pre-calibration** (no ChArUco
board needed): `leadArmFlexion`, `tempoBackswing`, `tempoRatio`, and 2D turn proxies from the lone
camera — *plus*, the moment an IMU is worn, the **full orientation metric set at full fidelity**
because it is pure quaternion math needing no camera calibration and no triangulation:
`leadWristFlexExt`, `leadWristRadUln`, `forearmPronation` (Wrist session scores *for real* at MVP),
and with a pelvis+thorax pair `xFactor`, `xFactorStretch`, `pelvisRotation`, `thoraxRotation`,
`spineSideBend`, `spineForwardBend`, and the **body** `kinematicSequence`. **After single-camera
calibration** (intrinsics + one ground-plane board — *one* camera, not two): the frontal-plane
metric translations and tilts — `pelvisSway`, `pelvisLift`, `secondaryAxisTilt`, ground-plane-
scaled in-plane speeds — completing the `Mono3D+IMU` tier. **Only the depth-axis club / translation
metrics are deferred to later** (`pelvisThrust`, `clubPath`, `attackAngle`, `swingPlane`,
`clubheadSpeed`, `faceAngle`): these wait on the second (down-the-line) camera **or** a future
club-shaft IMU, and are surfaced via `SwingAnalysis.tier` + per-metric confidence so the UI prompts
the *right* upgrade — never shows a falsely-confident number, and never implies the lone-camera
user is getting a "fake" analysis.

### B) Scoring model

The score is **transparent and non-compensatory** by design: every number a coach sees traces to one metric, one reference band, one weight. No black-box ML.

**1. Per-metric sub-score (tolerance band, not naive z-score).** Each `ScoredMetric` maps its value to `subScore ∈ [0,100]` against a reference `(mu, sigma)` via a **deadband + bounded falloff**, so any tour-acceptable value scores 100 and deviations are never punished to absurdity:

```
z = (value - mu) / sigma
if |z| <= zIn:            subScore = 100            // green band, deadband
elif |z| <= zOut:        subScore = 100 * (1 - ((|z|-zIn)/(zOut-zIn))^p)   // yellow→red ramp
else:                    subScore = 0
```

with `zIn≈1.0`, `zOut≈3.0`, `p≈2` (or a Gaussian `100·exp(−½((|z|−zIn)/k)²)`). **One-sided** metrics (a fault only in one direction — e.g. cupped `leadWristFlexExt` at impact, negative `tempoRatio` deviation) use a half-band: the "good" side is clamped to 100. Band membership sets the `band` string (`green`/`yellow`/`red`) for the UI strip. This piecewise form is the explicit cure for over-penalization that pure z-scores cause (jitter + demoralizing zeros).

**2. Phase-aware comparison.** Every metric is read at its **matched phase event** (see catalog), never frame-aligned blindly. Reference `(mu,sigma)` are also phase-specific (`leadWristFlexExt` at Top ≠ at Impact). The `PhaseSegmenter` anchors on `job.impactUs` (the hard timestamp) and detects Top via hand-velocity reversal and transition via proximal-to-distal peak-velocity ordering.

**3. Optional DTW trajectory similarity.** `CoachAnalyzer` (and any tier with a stored reference) adds a shape sub-score: body-scale-normalized (shoulder-width), pelvis-centered joint trajectories warped against a recorded reference swing with an **impact anchor + Sakoe-Chiba band** (DTW_cpp, MIT, header-only — band added in our DP fill). The per-phase/per-region warp cost maps through the same band falloff to a `dtwShape` sub-score, catching path faults (over-the-top, casting) that discrete positions miss. Distance is attributed per joint/phase so faults are localizable.

**4. Weighting & aggregation (weighted geometric mean).** Sub-scores aggregate in two levels — into per-**region** (`perRegion`) and per-**phase** (`perPhase`) scores, then into `overall` — using the **weighted geometric mean**, never arithmetic:

```
agg = exp( Σ wᵢ·ln(max(sᵢ, 1)) ),   Σ wᵢ = 1
```

Geometric mean is **weakest-link**: one catastrophic fault (over-the-top at 10) drags the overall down ~2× harder than averaging and **cannot be masked** by good posture/tempo elsewhere — the precise failure of naive averaging. Sub-scores are floored at 1 to avoid `log(0)`. Weights live in a **versioned config table** the coach can see and tune; default rationale: impact > transition > top > address by phase; kinematic-sequence/rotation > wrist > tempo by region (sequence is the most coach-trusted, AUC ~0.97 pro-vs-amateur in SPI). Per-session-type weight tables differ (Wrist weights wrist metrics heavily; GRF weights sway/weight-shift).

**5. Reference-target sourcing.** Tier 1 ships now: a hardcoded versioned `(metric, phase, mu, sigma, oneSided, weight)` table from the literature (SPI rotational velocities; TPI/accelerometer tempo; HackMotion wrist bands; TrackMan club). Band widths scale by **skill level and club** so a mid-handicap is not scored against scratch SDs. Tier 2 (later): recorded reference swings per athlete (`athleteUuid`) for the DTW term and "vs your best swing" comparison.

**6. Ranked faults.** `FaultRanker` keys a rule table on `(metric, phase, sign-of-deviation)`, computes `pointsLost = weight × (100 − subScore)`, sorts descending, and emits the **top 1–3** `Fault`s with plain-English cause + drill. Examples: arm peak-velocity time before thorax → "Arms firing early (over-the-top tendency)"; `tempoRatio` ≪ 3:1 → "Quick from the top"; positive `leadWristFlexExt` at impact → "Cupped lead wrist / open face — loss of compression"; negative pelvis→thorax sequence gap → "No separation — upper and lower firing together". The score earns attention; the ranked faults are the actionable coaching.

**Concrete C++ types** (in `pinpoint::analysis`, matching the architecture's intermediate structs):

```cpp
struct ScoredMetric {
    QString key;            // e.g. "xFactor"  — matches MetricSeries::key
    double  value;          // measured scalar at scoring phase
    double  mu, sigma;      // reference band centre/spread (skill+club scaled)
    bool    oneSided;       // half-band (directional fault) if true
    double  subScore;       // 0..100 after band falloff
    QString band;           // "green" | "yellow" | "red"
    Phase   phase;          // phase the value was read at
    double  weight;         // aggregation weight (from config table)
};

struct Fault {
    QString id, title, cause, drill;   // rule + human-readable coaching
    double  pointsLost;                // weight * (100 - subScore), ranking key
    Phase   phase;
};

struct ScoreBreakdown {
    int                      overall;       // 0..100, weighted geometric mean
    QHash<QString,int>       perRegion;     // "rotation","wrist","tempo","sequence","posture"
    QHash<QString,int>       perPhase;      // by Phase name
    std::vector<ScoredMetric> metrics;      // full audit trail
};
```

`ScoreBreakdown` and the `std::vector<Fault>` live inside `SwingAnalysis` (the `ShotAnalysisResult::detail` shared_ptr); `overall` is copied into the flat `ShotAnalysisResult::score` for the unchanged `addShot()` path, and folded inline into `swing.json`'s additive `"analysis"` object at `maybeJoin()` for cross-restart persistence. **Validation gates:** reproduce SPI pro-vs-amateur separation (AUC ~0.97) on the rotational-velocity sub-scores, and check `overall` correlates with coach ratings (DMSM reached κ≈0.71) before the score is trusted in the UI.

## Metric time series & key-swing-point sampling

Every biomechanics metric is **two things at once**: a *continuous per-frame curve* over the swing window's master timeline, and a *sparse set of labelled samples* at each key swing point. The graph needs both — the curve to draw the line, the phase samples to place markers, pin checkpoint readouts, and drive scoring. Both live in the committed `pinpoint::analysis` structs (`docs/design/shot_analyzer_design.md:146-161`); this subsection makes them buildable and persistent. None of it exists in code yet — `src/Analysis/swing_analysis.{h,cpp}` is **to be ADDED**; `ShotAnalysisResult` (`src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.h:47-53`) today carries only `score`/`metrics`/`tracePoints`.

### 1. Data model — TimeGrid, MetricSeries, PhaseSample

**Master clock (`TimeGrid`).** All streams are resampled onto one ascending `std::vector<int64_t> t_us` (`TimeGrid`, design line 128) built by the analyzer worker. Cadence rule:

- **Primary grid = the face-on camera-frame timeline** (each frame's `IndexEntry::timestamp_us`, `src/Buffer/types.h:56-57`). This guarantees one curve sample per displayed/replayed frame, so the playhead lands exactly on a series sample with no interpolation — and it tolerates variable capture rate (the same nearest-preceding model the replay uses, `shot_processor.cpp:484-492`).
- **Fallback grid = fixed 200 Hz** when no usable camera stream exists (IMU-only Wrist shots): `t_us = startUs + k·5000` across `[SwingWindow::startTimestampUs(), endTimestampUs()]` (`src/Buffer/swing_window.h:47-48`). 200 Hz over-samples the 100 Hz IMU so the curve is smooth and phase peak-finding is precise.

**IMU 100 Hz → wrist angles → grid.** The WT901 delivers quaternions at 100 Hz. The analyzer reads them via `SwingWindow::interpolateImu(SourceId, target_us, …)` (`src/Buffer/swing_window.h`), which slerps between the two bracketing in-window samples (no extrapolation, per the quaternions-only rule — never lerp Euler). For each grid `t_us` it interpolates the lead-wrist and lead-forearm quaternions, applies the swing-twist decomposition (M1 §4), and emits the scalar angle. Result: one `MetricSeries::value[i]` per `TimeGrid` index.

**Extend `MetricSeries` with phase samples** (the curve alone has no markers):

```cpp
namespace pinpoint::analysis {

struct PhaseSample {                 // ADD — a labelled point on one metric's curve
    Phase   phase;                   // Address … Finish (design line 150)
    int64_t t_us;                    // == the PhaseEvent t_us for this phase
    double  value;                   // metric value sampled at t_us (grid-interpolated)
    QString band;                    // "green"/"yellow"/"red" at scored phases, else ""
};

struct MetricSeries {                // EXTEND the committed struct (design line 146)
    QString key, label, unit;
    std::vector<int64_t> t_us;       // == the shared TimeGrid
    std::vector<double>  value;      // one per t_us — the continuous curve
    std::vector<PhaseSample> phaseSamples;   // ADD — sparse, ≤8 markers
    std::optional<double> bandLo, bandHi;    // ADD — ideal/tour band (unit-space), for shaded plot
    bool flexPositive = true;        // ADD — canonical sign flag (see §2)
};

}   // namespace
```

The **`PhaseEvent` timeline is shared across all metrics** — it is computed once per shot (`std::vector<PhaseEvent> SwingAnalysis::phases`, design line 158) by the PhaseSegmenter, and each metric's `phaseSamples` simply samples its own curve at those eight `t_us`. So all curves' markers line up vertically on a common x-axis. Impact is the hard anchor: `PhaseEvent{Phase::Impact, job.impactUs}` taken verbatim from the ShotMarker (`ShotAnalysisJob::impactUs`, `shot_analyzer.h:37`), never re-derived. The other seven phases are segmenter output (Butterworth/SG-filtered peak-finding, design line 356); low-confidence phases are flagged so QML can fade their ticks.

### 2. Time axis, units, sign, ideal band

- **Impact-relative time axis.** Plot x as `t_us − job.impactUs`, so **impact = 0**, backswing negative, follow-through positive. This makes the playhead, phase ticks, and (later) multi-shot overlay trivially correct, and matches impact-normalised comparison conventions. Store absolute `t_us` in `MetricSeries`; subtract at render time.
- **Units** carried per-series in `MetricSeries::unit` ("°", "°/s", "m"). The y-axis labels and the value-at-playhead readout read it directly; never overlay different-unit metrics on one axis.
- **Sign convention (canonical, stored).** The M1 internal convention is **flexion +, extension −** (`flexPositive = true`). HackMotion-trained coaches expect the opposite (extension/cupping up). The fix: **store the canonical M1 sign in `value[]`** and flip *only at the QML readout/axis label* — never re-sign the stored series (it would invert scoring). `flexPositive` documents the stored polarity so the chart knows which way to flip.
- **Ideal/tour band (optional).** `bandLo`/`bandHi` (unit-space, one-sided allowed: leave one `nullopt`) drive a semi-transparent shaded region drawn **only across the scored phases** (Top, Impact for Wrist), not the full axis. For one-sided metrics (cupping = fault, bowed = fine) shade only the fault side, matching `SwingScorer`'s good-side clamp.

### 3. Persistence — unified `swing.json` (folded at the join)

The full series + phase markers must survive replay-window destruction (`finishShot()` destroys `m_swingWindow`, `shot_processor.cpp:537-548`) **and** app restart — persisted in the **single** `swing.json` document, never a separate file.

**One document, one writer, written once.** Raw manifest and derived analysis live in the same `swing.json` (schema bumped **`pinpoint.swing/1` → `pinpoint.swing/2`**; the additive `"analysis"` object is the only new content, so `/1` readers stay forward-compatible). Because the exporter and analyzer run concurrently over the frozen window, **neither writes the file**:

- `SwingExporter::run()` writes **media only** (MP4s, `thumb.jpg`) and **returns** its already-assembled raw manifest by value in `SwingExportResult.manifest` (`QJsonObject`) — the JSON tree it builds in memory (`swing_exporter.cpp:341-456`) is handed out instead of written (the `QSaveFile` block at `:458-468` is deleted).
- `ShotAnalyzer::analyze()` stays pure-return (`ShotAnalysisResult`), touching no disk.

The single authoritative write happens on the **GUI thread** at `ShotProcessor::maybeJoin()` (`shot_processor.cpp:395-435`) — the existing barrier that runs only after **both** `QFutureWatcher`s resolve. There, `SwingDocWriter::writeSwingJson(swingDir, m_exportManifest, analysisOk ? &result : nullptr, thumbTusOffset)` composes raw + derived into one tree and commits **atomically** (`QSaveFile` temp + `commit()` rename). **No parallel-write race is possible** — the analyzer writes nothing, the exporter writes only media, and the lone `swing.json` write is serial on the GUI thread after both workers have delivered.

The analyzer's `SwingAnalysis` is serialised **inline** under `"analysis"` (no `{file}` indirection):

```jsonc
{ "schema": "pinpoint.swing/2",
  "swing": {...}, "athlete": {...}, "clock": {...}, "window": {...},
  "thumbnail": { "file": "thumb.jpg", "t_us": ... },
  "streams": [ /* raw video/imu entries — UNCHANGED from /1 */ ],
  "analysis": {                                  // additive, present iff analysis ok
    "schema": "pinpoint.analysis/2",             // versions the embedded block
    "impactUs": 172834905123,                    // x-axis zero
    "timeGrid": [ /* ascending t_us */ ],
    "phases": [ {"phase":"Top","t_us":172834700000,"conf":0.82}, ... ],
    "metrics": [ { "key":"leadWristFlexExt", "label":"Lead-Wrist Flex/Ext", "unit":"°",
                   "flexPositive": true, "bandLo": -5, "bandHi": 5,
                   "value": [ /* one per timeGrid index */ ],
                   "phaseSamples": [ {"phase":"Impact","t_us":172834905123,"value":-18.4,"band":"green"}, ... ] } ],
    "score": { /* ScoreBreakdown */ } } }
```

**Degradation (always write what is available).** `addShot()` is unconditional, so `writeSwingJson()` writes whatever exists: export ok + analysis ok -> raw + `"analysis"`; export ok + analysis fail -> raw only (`"analysis"` omitted); export fail + analysis ok -> a minimal header synthesised from `SwingExportJob` values + `"analysis"`, `streams: []`; both fail -> nothing written. **Teardown caveat:** `finishNowBlocking()` bypasses `maybeJoin()`, so an interrupted shot persists nothing unless `finishNowBlocking()` itself calls `writeSwingJson()` with the results in hand.

**Reload.** One reader, `SwingDocReader::readSwingJson(dir)`, rehydrates **both** raw and derived from the single document (media paths + thumbnail from the top level; score/metrics/series from `"analysis"`), feeding a new `ShotListModel::addPersistedShot(swingDir, ..., rating, note, trashed)`. *(Reload is future work; the unified document makes it one read, not two.)*

**In-memory → QML** — widen `ShotAnalysisResult` with `std::shared_ptr<SwingAnalysis> detail` (design line 156), forward it through `ShotProcessor::maybeJoin()` → `ShotListModel::addShot()` (`shot_processor.cpp:411-417`), and add a **`SeriesRole`** to `ShotListModel::Roles` (`src/Gui/shot_list_model.h:48-61`) that exposes the metrics as a `QVariantList` of typed maps `{key,label,unit,t_us,value,phaseSamples,bandLo,bandHi,flexPositive}` plus a `PhasesRole` (`[{phase,t_us,conf}]`). Register `Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(std::shared_ptr<SwingAnalysis>)`. This is **distinct from the existing `TracePointsRole`** (`shot_list_model.h`), which stays the lossy normalised 0..1 sparkline for the card.

### 4. Downsampling — card sparkline vs detail graph

- **Detail graph** consumes the **full `value[]`** at native grid density (~120–200 pts over 5 s — cheap for a `Shape` `PathPolyline`). No downsampling; the playhead must land on real samples.
- **Card sparkline** keeps the existing `TracePointsRole` (normalised 0..1, `PpTrace.qml`). The analyzer derives it once by **LTTB-downsampling the primary metric to ~24 points** then normalising t and value into 0..1 (y down). This is backward-compatible — `PpShotCard`/`PpTrace` are unchanged — and decouples the tiny card glyph from the heavy detail series.

## Implementation Plan

This plan takes the team from the four stub analyzers in `src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.cpp` to the full nine-layer `pinpoint::analysis` pipeline. It is sequenced so **every milestone ships standalone, user-visible value** and never breaks the existing `analyze()` → `addShot()` → carousel path. Each phase keeps the `ShotAnalyzer::analyze(const SwingWindow&, const ShotAnalysisJob&)` signature, the frozen-window const-reader contract, and the quaternions-only rule. Phases build strictly on the layer model: M0 plumbing → M1 monocular skeleton + naive score → M2 calibration + stereo → M3 IMU fusion + advanced metrics → M4 smoothing/occlusion → M5 reference scoring + feedback → M6 polish/validation.

### M0 — Plumbing & persistence skeleton (no biomechanics yet)

**Goal / outcome.** The result struct, job struct, the unified `swing.json` writer/reader, and module scaffold exist and round-trip; the carousel score now *persists across restart* in the single document. No new math, but the seam every later phase plugs into is locked.

**New files / classes.**
- `src/Analysis/biomech_analyzer.{h,cpp}` — `BiomechAnalyzer` base owning the (initially empty) layer pipeline; `SwingAnalyzer`/`WristAnalyzer`/`GrfAnalyzer`/`CoachAnalyzer` derive from it.
- `src/Analysis/swing_analysis.{h,cpp}` — the canonical intermediate structs (`SkeletonTimeline`, `MetricSeries`, `ScoreBreakdown`, `Fault`, `SwingAnalysis`, `ReconstructionTier`), `Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(std::shared_ptr<SwingAnalysis>)`.
- `src/Export/swing_doc.{h,cpp}` — `SwingDocWriter::writeSwingJson(swingDir, rawManifest, const SwingAnalysis*, thumbTusOffset)` + `SwingDocReader::readSwingJson(swingDir)` for the single unified document (**replaces** the never-built `analysis_io`/`analysis.json`).

**Changes to existing files.**
- `src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.h` — widen `ShotAnalysisJob` (add `cameraCalib`, `imuBindings`, `handedness`, `club`, `athleteUuid`, `swingDir`, `cameraFixedInPlace`); add `std::shared_ptr<SwingAnalysis> detail` to `ShotAnalysisResult`; `makeShotAnalyzer()` returns the new classes (still producing the old stub `score`/`metrics` so the carousel is unchanged).
- `src/Gui/shot_processor.{h,cpp}` — in `startAnalysis()` populate the new job fields on the UI thread (read `AppSettings`, `ImuInstance::alignA()/mountM()`, `SwingPaths` swingDir); `onSwingSaveFinished()` stashes the exporter's returned `m_exportManifest`; `maybeJoin()` calls `SwingDocWriter::writeSwingJson()` once (both done) **then** `addShot()` with the flat fields + `result.detail`.
- `src/Gui/shot_list_model.{h,cpp}` — add an `analysisDetail` role holding the pointer + an `addPersistedShot(swingDir, ...)` entry; on app start, `SwingDocReader::readSwingJson()` rehydrates `score`/`metrics` from the single `swing.json`'s `"analysis"` object.
- `src/Export/swing_exporter.{h,cpp}` — `run()` no longer writes `swing.json`; it writes **media only** and returns the assembled raw manifest in `SwingExportResult.manifest` (`QJsonObject`) + `thumbnailTusOffset`.
- `CMakeLists.txt` — add the new `src/Analysis/**` sources to the target. Eigen is already on the include path (`${eigen_SOURCE_DIR}`, line 482) — **no CMake dependency change**.

**Exit criteria.** A manual SHOT writes one `swing.json` containing both the raw manifest and the `"analysis"` block; restarting the app shows the same score on the carousel card. Unit test: serialize→deserialize a populated `SwingAnalysis` round-trips losslessly through `swing_doc`.

### M1 — Monocular skeleton + IMU orientation metrics + banded score (`Angles2D` → `Mono3D+IMU`)

**Goal / outcome.** Real numbers on **one camera, possibly pre-calibration**: camera 2D angles
(lead-arm flexion, turn proxies, tempo) **and** the full IMU orientation metric set, with a
transparent banded score replacing the timestamp-hash. Every single-camera owner benefits
immediately; the Wrist session scores for real.

**New files / classes.**
- `src/Analysis/decode/frame_decoder.{h,cpp}` — `FrameDecoder`, zero-copy `cv::Mat` wrap +
  demosaic, factored out of `swing_exporter.cpp`'s demosaic table.
- `src/Analysis/detect/pose_runner.{h,cpp}` — `PoseRunner` reusing the `PoseEstimatorBase` ORT EP
  cascade, run **offline** per decoded frame (no `FrameThrottle`). Use the already-wired `PoseEstimatorViTPose` and **upgrade the model to ViTPose-L/H** — the analyzer is offline, so favour accuracy over the live path's MoveNet.
- `src/Analysis/phase/phase_segmenter.{h,cpp}` — `PhaseSegmenter` anchored on `job.impactUs`,
  detecting Top/Transition from **IMU angular-velocity zero-crossings** (sharper than 2D) with a
  2D keypoint-velocity fallback when no IMU.
- `src/Analysis/fusion/imu_vision_fuser.{h,cpp}` *(orientation-only slice, pulled forward)* — apply
  `q_anat = A·q_raw·M` from `job.imuBindings`; **no camera calibration needed for orientation
  metrics**, so the swing-twist extractions land at M1.
- `src/Analysis/metrics/metric_extractor.{h,cpp}` — 2D `MetricSeries` (elbow angle, axial-turn
  proxy, tempo) **plus** the camera-independent IMU metrics: `xFactor`, `xFactorStretch`,
  `leadWristFlexExt`, `leadWristRadUln`, `forearmPronation`, `pelvisRotation`, `thoraxRotation`,
  `spineSideBend`/`spineForwardBend`, and the **body** `kinematicSequence` (per-segment `‖ω‖`
  peak ordering/timing).
- `src/Analysis/score/swing_scorer.{h,cpp}` — tolerance-band sub-scores + **weighted geometric
  mean**; `reference_tables.h`.

**Changes.** `BiomechAnalyzer` runs layers 0→1→3(orientation)→6→7 with `tier = Angles2D` when no
IMU, `Mono3D+IMU` (orientation subset) when an IMU is bound — **no layer-2 triangulation and no
camera calibration required for the IMU metrics**. Per-shot heading re-zero (Kabsch yaw, gravity
shared) for heading-dependent metrics; inclination metrics are **not** re-zeroed (drift-free).
`ScreenWrist.qml` metric keys populated from real values.

**New dependency.** **ViTPose-L (or -H) ONNX** (Apache-2.0) — `PoseEstimatorViTPose` already exists
(ViTPose-B); add the larger variant through the existing `HAVE_VITPOSE` download/copy block. No
separate hand model: the same whole-body network's channels 91–132 supply the optional hand cross-check.

**Exit criteria.** Wrist FE/RUD within HackMotion-plausible bands on a hand-checked clip; X-factor
inside published tour bands on a pro reference; tempo within ±10 %; faults panel empty but
score-breakdown present. Deterministic metric output on a saved `SwingWindow` fixture.

### M2 — Single-camera metric calibration + monocular metric lift (`Mono3D+IMU` complete)

**Goal / outcome.** Promote the lone face-on camera to a **metric** sensor: intrinsics + **one**
ground-plane board → metric world frame + scale, monocular metric lift anchored by the IMU. Ships
the **complete `Mono3D+IMU` flagship tier on ONE camera** — frontal-plane translations and tilts
go live. **No second camera, no DLT, no triangulation in M2.**

**Calibration UX work item (ships with M2).**
- Replace the `CameraCalibrationFlow.qml` stub: (1) per-camera ChArUco intrinsic capture (15–30
  views, `cv::calibrateCamera`, **gate RMS < 0.5 px**); (2) **one** laid-down ground-plane ChArUco
  → per-camera `cv::solvePnP(SOLVEPNP_IPPE)`, board = world, **metric scale free from one camera**;
  (3) optional `subjectHeightM` / bone-length **no-board fallback** feeding lower confidence.
  Mirror the `ImuCalibrationFlow` host contract.
- `src/Gui/camera_calibrator.{h,cpp}` — the OpenCV calib3d solver behind the wizard.
- `src/Gui/app_settings.{h,cpp}` — `cameraIntrinsics`/`cameraExtrinsics` maps, RMS-gated
  `cameraCalibrated` flag, `subjectHeightM`/bone table (single-AppSettings-instance rule).

**New analyzer files.**
- `src/Analysis/recon/triangulator.{h,cpp}` — at M2 `Triangulator` runs its **`MonoLift` path**:
  `MotionBERT` (self-exported ONNX, fixed 243/81-frame, opset 17) with COCO-17→H36M-17 remap, the
  ground-plane `solvePnP` scale, and the no-board scale prior; depth-dependent metrics carry lower
  confidence. *(DLT is wired but dormant until a second calib is present.)*
- `src/Analysis/fusion/time_grid.{h,cpp}` — SLERP-quaternion / Catmull-Rom resample onto the
  master grid; **angular-velocity cross-correlation** for sub-frame IMU↔camera sync (1 ms = 45 mm
  — non-optional before any fused per-frame term).

**Changes.** `startAnalysis()` fills `job.cameraCalib` from the new maps (gated on
`cameraFixedInPlace`); `BiomechAnalyzer` selects `Mono3D+IMU` on **one** valid calib and runs the
monocular lift + IMU global anchoring (`ImuVisionFuser` supplies the toward/away bone-direction
constraint the face-on camera cannot see, resolving depth/flip for instrumented segments).
`MetricExtractor` gains `pelvisSway`, `pelvisLift`, `secondaryAxisTilt`, and ground-plane-scaled
in-plane speeds.

**New dependency.** OpenCV calib3d/objdetect (already linked; target the 4.7 `objdetect` ChArUco
API). MotionBERT ONNX (Apache-2.0, self-exported) — gate behind `WITH_FUSION`/GPU EP.

**Exit criteria.** Wand-of-known-length scales within 0.5 % from **one** camera; ground-plane
ChArUco corner reprojects < 1 px; 3D pelvis sway/lift plausible vs hand annotation; the full
`Mono3D+IMU` metric set produced **without a second camera**.

### M3 — Second-camera triangulation enhancement + IMU slot-map fix (`Stereo3D`; future club IMU)

**Goal / outcome.** Add the **down-the-line** camera **purely as an accuracy / occlusion
enhancement** that recovers the depth-axis metrics `Mono3D+IMU` genuinely cannot do — confidence
on existing metrics rises rather than metrics appearing for the first time. Also fix the IMU slot
map so X-factor/pelvis turn get a clean pelvis-vs-thorax pair.

**New / changed.**
- `Triangulator` **DLT path** goes live: `cv::undistortPoints` → confidence-weighted DLT (Eigen
  `JacobiSVD`, rows ×√conf) → one Gauss-Newton reprojection step; per-joint gating on
  dual-confidence + ray-angle [20°,160°] + reprojection residual; mirror/limb-swap rejection. The
  second camera's extrinsic comes from the **shared** M2 ground-plane board (both already
  intrinsically calibrated) — cheap relative pose, **no** `stereoCalibrate`.
- `BiomechAnalyzer` selects `Stereo3D` when **≥ 2** valid calibs; `MetricExtractor` now emits the
  depth-axis set — `pelvisThrust`, `clubPath`, `attackAngle`, `swingPlane` azimuth — and triangu-
  lation **upgrades the confidence** of every M2 in-plane/IMU metric (occlusion redundancy).
- **IMU slot-map fix (the real unlock for `xFactor`/`pelvisRotation`).** Add a true **pelvis** IMU
  option distinct from the thorax/lumbar/T12 triple, so the pelvis-vs-thorax pair is clean. This
  is an **instrumentation** change, *not* a camera gate.
- **(Parallel, future) `ClubInstrumented` hook.** A shaft/clubface IMU (`I2`) is the **orthogonal**
  upgrade to the second camera: `clubheadSpeed` via `v_grip + ω×r`, shaft lean, a `faceAngle`
  proxy, and the **club link** of the kinematic sequence — delivered **without** a second camera.
  Wire `job.imuBindings` to accept a `SegmentRole::Club` source; gyro FSR and shaft-flex caveats
  apply (label club state a coaching **proxy**, not launch-monitor truth).

**Changes.** `startAnalysis()` resolves `AppSettings::imuPlacement` + `ImuInstance::alignA()/
mountM()` into `job.imuBindings` (incl. the new pelvis / future club roles). `GrfAnalyzer` consumes
thigh/lumbar IMUs (GRF kinematically estimated, clearly labelled — no force-plate source).

**Exit criteria.** With the DTL camera, `clubPath`/`attackAngle`/`pelvisThrust` populate within
published bands and the M2 metrics' confidence rises; **without** it, the full `Mono3D+IMU` set
remains complete (proving the second camera is an enhancement, not a gate). Sign convention
validated against `mirroredSource`/handedness; occluded segments stay IMU-reconstructed.

> **Knock-on to M0 and M4–M6.** **M0** is unchanged except that `ReconstructionTier` now enumerates
> `{Angles2D, Mono3DPlusImu, Stereo3D, ClubInstrumented}` and `ShotAnalysisJob` adds
> `subjectHeightM` + per-subject bone lengths (for the §0(c) no-board prior) alongside `cameraCalib`
> / `imuBindings`. **M4** (`TrackSmoother` + `SkeletonSolver` IK) is unchanged but now operates on a
> pipeline whose **single-camera** output is already a complete product before any second camera
> exists; bone lengths feed both the IK and the §0(c) scale prior. **M5/M6** are unchanged in scope;
> M6's degradation-tier matrix exercises the **two-axis** capability model (camera × IMU), and the
> recalibration prompt is per-tier ("add a DTL camera for club path" vs. "add a club sensor for
> clubhead speed") rather than a generic "recalibrate".

### M4 — Smoothing, occlusion robustness, IK skeleton

**Goal / outcome.** Jitter-free, anatomically valid 3D suitable for replay overlay and stable metrics; the `SkeletonTimeline` drives `BodyVizView`.

**New files / classes.**
- `src/Analysis/cleanup/track_smoother.{h,cpp}` — `TrackSmoother`: per-joint constant-acceleration Kalman + Rauch-Tung-Striebel backward smoother over the whole window (offline ⇒ future samples available; predict-only on missing frames, R∝1/confidence, per-joint jerk PSD).
- `src/Analysis/skeleton/skeleton_solver.{h,cpp}` — `SkeletonSolver`: weighted-LS IK over joint angles with fixed bone lengths (calibrated from a clean address frame) + ROM box limits → per-bone `QQuaternion` `SkeletonTimeline`.

**Changes.** `BodyPoseAdapter` gains an offline-skeleton consumption path (replay shows the analyzed swing, not live keypoints); `ShotProcessor` replay can drive it. Bone-length and joint-limit constants in `reference_tables.h`.

**New dependency.** **Ceres Solver** (BSD-3, pulls Eigen) for the IK nonlinear solve and the extrinsic bundle-adjustment polish — `find_package(Ceres)` in CMakeLists.txt, gated behind `WITH_FUSION`; CPU-only is fine. Kalman/RTS/Kabsch are pure Eigen (no new dep).

**Exit criteria.** Reconstructed clubhead trajectory is smooth through impact with no RTS overshoot; bone lengths constant ±2 mm; reprojection of smoothed skeleton < 3 px both views.

### M5 — Reference-swing scoring + ranked feedback

**Goal / outcome.** A trustworthy 0-100 score with red/yellow/green per-metric strip, a kinematic-sequence graph, and the top 1-3 ranked faults with drills — the coaching product.

**New files / classes.**
- `src/Analysis/feedback/fault_ranker.{h,cpp}` — `FaultRanker`: rule table keyed on (metric, phase, sign), ranked by points-lost (weight × deviation).
- `src/Analysis/score/dtw_similarity.{h,cpp}` — phase-anchored, body-scale-normalized, Sakoe-Chiba-banded multivariate DTW shape sub-score against a stored reference swing (`CoachAnalyzer` especially: over-the-top/casting).
- Reference-swing storage under the athlete library (`athleteLibraryPath`); a "set as reference" action in the shot detail UI.

**Changes.** `SwingScorer` adds the DTW term + per-region/per-phase aggregation; `swing.json`'s `"analysis"` object carries the full `ScoreBreakdown` + faults. Detail UI (QML) reads `analysisDetail`.

**New dependency.** **DTW_cpp** (MIT, single header) dropped into `src/Analysis/score/` — add the Sakoe-Chiba band ourselves; no CMake change.

**Exit criteria.** Overall score correlates with a coach's manual ranking on ≥10 recorded swings (target Cohen's κ ≈ 0.7); a deliberate over-the-top swing surfaces the matching ranked fault; geometric-mean aggregation demonstrably drags one severe fault down.

### M6 — Polish, performance, cross-platform validation

**Goal / outcome.** Productionized: latency-budgeted, degradation-tier-complete, cross-platform GPU-verified.

**Work.** `IntraOpNumThreads(1)` on all analyzer ORT sessions to avoid contending with the exporter's x264 encode; per-`analyze()` session construction confirmed; latency profiling (target ≈2-4 s GPU / ≤10 s CPU on a 5 s window). Full degradation-tier matrix exercised. UI prompts for recalibration when reprojection RMS spikes (calibration drift).

**Exit criteria.** All four session types run end-to-end on macOS (CoreML), Linux (CUDA/CPU), Windows (DirectML/CPU); shot always lands on carousel even on `ok=false`.

### New-dependencies summary

| Dependency | Phase | Purpose | License | Platform / acquisition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Eigen 3.4 | M0 | DLT SVD, Kalman/RTS, Kabsch, quaternion math | MPL-2.0 | **Already fetched** (`${eigen_SOURCE_DIR}`) — no change |
| OpenCV calib3d/objdetect | M2 | ChArUco, calibrate/solvePnP, undistort/triangulate | Apache-2.0 | **Already linked** |
| **ViTPose-L/H ONNX** | M1 | Offline 2D body keypoints — accuracy-first (analyzer is offline) | Apache-2.0 | `PoseEstimatorViTPose` already wired (ViTPose-B); swap to the larger variant via the existing `HAVE_VITPOSE` download/copy block |
| ViTPose-wholebody hands | M1 (optional) | Lead-hand 133-kpt camera cross-check | Apache-2.0 | **Same** ViTPose model — expose discarded channels 91–132; no separate model or download |
| MotionBERT ONNX | **M2** | Single-camera metric lift (`Mono3D+IMU`) | Apache-2.0 | Self-exported fixed-243-frame, GPU EP, `WITH_FUSION` |
| Ceres Solver | M4 | IK solve + extrinsic bundle adjustment | BSD-3 | `find_package(Ceres)`, CPU, `WITH_FUSION` |
| DTW_cpp | M5 | Reference-swing shape similarity | MIT | Single header into `src/Analysis/score/` |

**Explicitly rejected (licensing):** Ultralytics YOLOv8/v11 (AGPL-3.0, incompatible), GolfDB/SwingNet weights and Roboflow golf datasets (CC-BY-NC, non-commercial). MediaPipe is Apache-2.0 but adds a second runtime — ViTPose keeps everything on ONNX Runtime.

### Validation strategy

- **Offline unit tests on saved `SwingWindow` fixtures.** Capture a handful of real shots, serialize the frozen window (or replay-track + payloads) as a test fixture; assert deterministic metric/score output per phase. These run headless, no buffer/GUI.
- **Reprojection error gates.** Calibration RMS < 0.5 px; static ChArUco corner < 1 px; smoothed-skeleton reprojection < 3 px in both views. Wired into the wizard status column and as test assertions.
- **Known-geometry rigs.** Wand of measured length triangulated within 0.5%; a printed protractor / known elbow angle on a held pose validates angle extraction sign and magnitude.
- **Tour-range regression.** Assert X-factor, X-factor-stretch, peak segment velocities, tempo ratio fall inside the published literature bands on labelled pro reference clips; catches sign/sequence-convention bugs immediately.
- **Coach-agreement validation (M5).** Score ≥10 recorded swings against a coach's ranking; target κ ≈ 0.7 (DMSM) and reproduce SPI-style pro-vs-amateur separation (AUC ≈ 0.97) on the rotational-velocity metrics.
- **Cross-platform smoke (M6).** Each session type end-to-end on all three GPU paths.

### Risks & open questions

1. **Self-occlusion (worst single-camera).** A lone face-on camera cannot see trail-side limbs through the body (and a DTL-only view hides the lead side); with two cameras each fills the other. Mitigated by IMU segment-fill + per-joint gating + freeze-on-low-confidence (mirror `BodyPoseAdapter` policy) — but joints with no IMU and single-view occlusion stay unreliable. Surface per-joint confidence to the UI rather than fabricate.
2. **IMU count & placement.** Current wiring supports 3 A/B/C slots; there is **no club/shaft IMU**, so clubhead speed and face angle are wrist-IMU/vision proxies (~12% error from shaft flex). **Resolution:** M3 adds a clean pelvis-vs-thorax pair (the real unlock for `xFactor`/`pelvisRotation`) and a `SegmentRole::Club` shaft-IMU hook — both *instrumentation* upgrades, orthogonal to (and cheaper than) a second camera. The single-camera owner reaches club + clean-rotation metrics by adding a *sensor*, not a *camera*.
3. **Model latency on a 5 s window.** ~2 detectors × 1–2 cameras × ~300 frames per shot. `IntraOpNumThreads(1)` plus the exporter contend for GPU. Budget ≈2-4 s GPU; if exceeded, frame-decimate the pose pass in slow phases or cap detector resolution.
4. **Calibration drift.** Extrinsics silently corrupt 3D if a camera moves after calibration. Gate the 3D path on `cameraFixedInPlace`, monitor reprojection RMS at runtime, and prompt recalibration on spikes.
5. **Cross-platform GPU.** ONNX has no Vulkan EP — a Vulkan-only Linux box (AMD/Intel, no CUDA) falls back to CPU for the analyzer. Verify the CPU latency budget there; never trust `#ifdef WITH_CUDA` for the runtime decision.
6. **Temporal sync.** Software-timestamp-only; 1 ms skew = 45 mm clubhead error. The IMU impact instant is the gold-standard common clock; sub-frame camera offset must be estimated (M3 angular-velocity cross-correlation) before any club/ball metric is trusted.
7. **No force-plate for GRF.** `GrfAnalyzer` estimates ground reaction kinematically and must label outputs as estimates until a force source is added.

## Implementation notes (as-built, M1)

> As-built status after **M1 (Wrist Motion)** — what shipped, decisions taken along the way,
> and what was deferred. M1 is on `main` (analysis engine → scorer → unified persistence +
> reload → replay-synced multi-metric graphs → live check-sensors overlay + hardware
> sign-lock). Companions: `docs/implementation/shot_analyzer_m1_wrist.md` (§11 = tidy-up checklist) and
> `docs/reference/wristmetrics.md` (sign/axis/naming + norms). `docs/design/shot_analyzer_viz.md` covers the
> graph work.
>
> **Scope:** M1 as shipped was the **IMU-orientation** path only — pose/triangulation layers
> (1, 2, 4, 5) and camera metric calibration were unimplemented at M1, so "monocular skeleton"
> below is as-built IMU-orientation-only.
>
> **⚠ This section is the M1 milestone snapshot and is now partly stale.** The offline pose pass
> (layer 1) and the `ShaftTracker` club pipeline landed *after* M1 and now run in production. See
> **Appendix C — Checkpoint review (2026-06-17)** for the current as-built state; the notes below
> are corrected inline where they would otherwise mislead.

### Architecture & data pipeline — as-built
- **Layers implemented:** 3 (`ImuVisionFuser`) and 6 (`PhaseSegmenter`); **1/2/4/5 not in M1**.
  *(Updated 2026-06-17: layer 1 — offline `PoseRunner`/ViTPose — and the `ShaftTracker` club
  pipeline landed post-M1 and now run in `WristAnalyzer`, swing-span bounded per segmentation
  v3 G3; layers 2/4/5 remain unbuilt.)*
- **Canonical structures** (`src/Analysis/swing_analysis.h`): `SegmentRole`,
  `ImuSegmentBinding {SourceId, role, alignA, mountM}`, `ReconstructionTier`,
  `Phase`/`PhaseEvent`/`PhaseSample`, `MetricSeries`, `ScoredMetric`, `ScoreBreakdown`,
  `SwingAnalysis`. **Decision:** `MetricSeries.value` is **neutral-relative (absolute posture
  vs the calibration neutral)**, with the Address phase-sample carried so a scalar
  Δ-from-address is derived in the UI.
- **Seam:** `ShotAnalyzer` ABC + `makeShotAnalyzer(sessionType)`; `WristAnalyzer` for type 1.
  Runs as a `QtConcurrent` worker ∥ `SwingExporter` over the frozen `SwingWindow`.
- **Tier:** `Mono3DPlusImu` (IMU orientation, no triangulation). **Decision (single-camera-
  first):** degrade gracefully — no hard M2 triangulation gate.
- **Source-layout decision:** `src/Analysis` is **flat**; standalone tests in
  `src/Analysis/tests/`. The `src/Analysis/<layer>/` paths in this doc are logical, not literal.

### Algorithms — as-built
- **§3 `ImuVisionFuser`** — implemented: `q_anat = alignA·qRaw·mountM`, 200 Hz
  intersected-coverage grid. **IMU-only** today (no camera-fusion term yet).
- **§6 `PhaseSegmenter`** — implemented (Address = motion onset, Top = lead-hand furthest
  from Address, Impact = marker anchor, Finish). Heuristic; full P-system detection deferred.
- **Sign/axis lock (key correction):** wrist flexion/extension is rotation about **Z**,
  radial/ulnar deviation about **X** (the original spec was right; a transient "XZY" form had
  them swapped). `wristFlexExtDeviation` uses ZXY extraction; **hardware-locked** against a
  live capture, signs correct for the lead/left arm with **no left/right mirror**.
  **Deferred:** ~10–15° FE↔RUD cross-talk from the no-magnetometer **yaw being unobservable**
  between two sensors (`src/IMU/imu_base.h`); right-arm sign unverified.
- **§0 / layers 1, 2, 4, 5** — M2+. *(Updated 2026-06-17: layer 1 pose now shipped — see
  Appendix C; §0 camera calibration and layers 2/4/5 remain unbuilt.)*

### Metrics & scoring — as-built
- **Catalog (M1 wrist):** `leadWristFlexExt` (bow/cup), `leadWristRadUln` (hinge),
  `forearmPronation` (roll), `leadArmFlexion` (elbow). **Decision:** coaching names + ISB signs
  (`docs/reference/wristmetrics.md`); shared `wristMetricLabel()` used by analyzer + live readout.
- **Reference-frame decision:** **neutral/absolute primary** — unifies the live readout with
  shot analysis, and **fixed a scorer reference mismatch** (it now grades the absolute impact
  posture against the absolute bands, not the address-delta).
- **§B `SwingScorer`** — implemented: deadband + bounded falloff, one-sided where directional,
  **weighted geometric mean** (weakest-link) → overall + per-region + per-phase, R/Y/G bands.
  **Deferred:** band **centres are provisional** (correct channels, untuned — need real-swing
  distributions; no public quartile source).

### Metric time series & sampling — as-built
- **Persistence decision:** ONE unified `swing.json` (`schema pinpoint.swing/2`, additive
  inline `analysis` block) written **once at the analyzer∥exporter join** by `SwingDocWriter`
  — exporter returns its raw manifest, analyzer is pure-return; no parallel-write race, no
  separate `analysis.json`. **Reload** (`SwingDocReader` + `addPersistedShot`) is **read-only**.
- **Graphs decision:** `PpMetricGraph` overlays **all four** curves on a shared degree axis
  with **filter chips** (legend + live value + scalar Δ-from-address); shown in the review
  panel **and** live in `ScreenWrist` during replay (`ShotProcessor::replayAnalysisDetail` +
  `replayPositionUs`), scrubbing with the ¼× video. `PpTrace` is the no-analysis fallback.
  **Deferred:** exact quaternion-referenced Δ curve (`wristRel`/`elbowRel` retained for it).

### Implementation Plan — status
- **M0** (plumbing/persistence): done.
- **M1**: **functionally complete** as the IMU-orientation path (engine, sign-lock, scorer,
  unified persistence + reload, replay-synced multi-metric graphs, live overlay). Tidy-ups in
  `shot_analyzer_m1_wrist.md §11`.
- **M2–M6**: ~~not started~~ *(stale — updated 2026-06-17)*. **Partial:** the offline `PoseRunner`/
  ViTPose pass, the `ShaftTracker` club pipeline (S0–S4), segmentation v2 + v3 (pass-1 ladder +
  heavy-stage bounding; pass-2 G4 on hold), and the SwingLab offline harness all shipped after M1.
  **Still not started:** camera metric calibration, `Triangulator`/DLT, MonoLift/MotionBERT, the
  body `TrackSmoother`/`SkeletonSolver` (no `SkeletonTimeline`), `FaultRanker`, DTW, and the
  Swing/GRF/Coach analyzers (still stubs). See **Appendix C** for the full breakdown.

### Cross-cutting deferred / follow-up
Reload set (rating/note, MP4 replay, export-fail header) · FE↔RUD cross-talk & shared-heading
(mag / kinematic / ROS-ENU frame contract) · right-arm sign · scorer band finalization · exact
Δ curve · ViTPose offline pose path (M2) · decouple the analyzer from the WT9011 quaternion
convention.

## Addendum — Swing segmentation v2 (`PhaseSegmenter` v2)

> **Status:** Design addendum (proposal) · **Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Grounded against:** `main` @ `474a6ba`
> · **Extended by the v3 addendum below** (shaft-aware two-pass; v2's inertial ladder becomes v3's
> pass 1 verbatim — read this addendum first, then the v3 deltas).
>
> Supersedes §6 (*Swing-phase segmentation*) and the as-built M1 `PhaseSegmenter` heuristic. Motivated by
> the shot-detection P1–P3 work: impact is now an **arbiter-fused, back-dated, sub-frame-accurate anchor**
> (Acoustic > IMU > Ball, `pinpoint::ShotArbiter`), which the v1 segmenter does not exploit beyond clamping.
> Goals: (a) an accurate **swing start / swing end** so the 5 s window can be logically truncated for
> export, replay, and metric grids; (b) a **richer event set** — the full P-system checkpoint ladder
> (address, takeaway, backswing checkpoints, transition, top, downswing delivery points, impact,
> release, follow-through, finish) — each with confidence and provenance.

### A.1 Why v1 falls short

The as-built M1 segmenter (`src/Analysis/phase_segmenter.cpp`) emits 4 events from one quaternion stream.
Specific weaknesses, in code:

1. **Address = first onset crossing, scanned forward from the grid edge.** Any pre-shot motion —
   a waggle, a regrip, walking into the stance inside the 5 s ring — crosses `onset` first and
   pins Address seconds too early. The "settle just before sustained motion" of the spec is not
   actually implemented; there is no stillness test and no *sustained* test.
2. **Top = orientation furthest from Address.** Correct only if Address is correct (see 1), and
   quaternion distance conflates body turn with wrist hinge — a late re-hinge can out-distance the
   true reversal point. There is no Transition event at all (the enum value exists, unused).
3. **Finish = `grid.back()` at conf 1.0.** That is the window edge (impact + ~500 ms post-roll),
   not a detected event — and with `kPostRoll* = 500 ms` the follow-through (~0.67 s typical) is
   physically truncated before it ends, so v1 *cannot* see the finish.
4. **The measured gyro is thrown away.** `ImuVisionFuser::fuse()` interpolates the full 40-byte
   `ImuSample` but keeps only `qAnat`; the segmenter then re-derives angular speed by differencing
   quaternions on the 200 Hz grid with a 5-sample boxcar — a noisier, phase-lagged copy of a signal
   the gyroscope measured directly at the sensor.
5. **No swing start/end output.** Exports, replay, and metric grids span the whole 5 s window;
   ~2–3 s of pre-shot standing-around is encoded into every MP4 and plotted under every metric curve.

### A.2 Design principles

1. **Impact is the anchor; search outward.** `job.impactUs` is the most accurate timestamp in the
   system (acoustic-or-IMU back-dated, arbiter-fused). Every other event is found by deterministic
   **backward** search (top → transition → takeaway → address) or **forward** search (release →
   follow-through → finish) from it, gated by physiological duration priors. Never scan forward
   from the window edge.
2. **Back-chain, don't threshold-scan.** Start each search *inside* the swing — a region of
   guaranteed high signal — and walk outward with hysteresis until the signal dies. This is
   waggle-proof by construction: the pre-swing noise is reached last, not first.
3. **Use the measured inertials.** The window stores raw gyro (°/s) and accel (g) per sample;
   `SwingWindow::interpolateImu` already lerps them. v2 extends `SegmentStream` with the resampled
   `gyro`/`accel` channels and uses |gyro| for energy envelopes, gyro projections for signed
   rotation rates, and accel for stillness tests. Quaternion-derived signals are reserved for what
   only orientation gives: gravity-referenced **inclination** (drift-free pitch of a segment axis)
   and swing-twist axial decompositions.
4. **Zero-phase filtering.** The window is offline, so use forward-backward (zero-phase) filtering —
   2nd-order Butterworth ≈ 10 Hz for energy envelopes, Savitzky-Golay where a derivative is needed.
   No phase lag means no systematic event-time bias (the v1 boxcar smears onsets by ~12 ms).
5. **Confidence + provenance per event; constraints over corrections.** Every `PhaseEvent` carries
   `conf` and (new) the segment it was measured from. The event chain must be monotone
   (Address ≤ Takeaway < MidBackswing < Transition ≤ Top < Downswing < Delivery < MaxSpeed ≤ Impact
   < Release < FollowThrough < Finish); a violating event is *dropped* (lower conf loses), never
   reordered.
6. **Degrade, never fabricate.** Lead hand/forearm IMU (always present in a Wrist session) yields
   the full hand-chain ladder; a pelvis IMU adds Transition; thorax adds a cross-check; a future
   club IMU / camera P-position detector upgrades the geometric checkpoints from approximations to
   exact. Missing sensor ⇒ the event is omitted (or emitted at low conf), not guessed.

### A.3 Event taxonomy — the P-system superset

The `Phase` enum is extended **append-only**: phases persist as raw ints in `swing.json`
(`swing_doc.cpp` writes `int(e.phase)` and the reload path matches `phase == 5`), so existing
values must keep their positions. (Tidy-up: replace the magic `5` with `int(Phase::Impact)`.)

| `Phase` (int) | P-system | Definition | Detector (v2) | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Address` (0) | P1 | End of last sustained stillness before the takeaway | §A.5 stillness back-search | hand or forearm IMU |
| `Takeaway` (1) | ≈P2 | Sustained motion onset of the backswing | §A.5 back-chain from Top | hand/forearm IMU |
| `MidBackswing` (8, new) | P3 | Lead arm parallel to ground (backswing) | forearm inclination ↑ crossing horizontal | forearm IMU |
| `Transition` (3) | — | Pelvis reverses while hands still going back (start of downswing sequence) | pelvis signed axial-rate zero-crossing before Top | pelvis IMU |
| `Top` (2) | P4 | Hand/club rotation reversal about the swing plane | §A.5 signed-rate zero-crossing | hand/forearm IMU |
| `Downswing` (4) | P5 | Lead arm parallel (downswing) | forearm inclination ↓ crossing horizontal | forearm IMU |
| `Delivery` (9, new) | P6 | Shaft parallel (downswing) | club-shaft inclination; hand-proxy at low conf until club IMU/camera | club IMU / camera |
| `MaxSpeed` (10, new) | — | Peak hand angular speed (clubhead-speed proxy) | argmax of hand \|gyro\| envelope in [Top, Impact+50 ms] | hand IMU |
| `Impact` (5) | P7 | The shot marker — unchanged hard anchor | `job.impactUs` | marker |
| `Release` (6) | P8 | Shaft/forearm parallel (follow-through) | first forward inclination crossing after impact | forearm IMU |
| `FollowThrough` (11, new) | P9 | Lead arm parallel (follow-through) | second forward crossing | forearm IMU |
| `Finish` (7) | P10 | Rotation decays to rest | sustained quiet onset after impact | any IMU |

`MidBackswing`/`Downswing`/`Delivery`/`Release`/`FollowThrough` are *geometric* checkpoints: from
IMU orientation they are approximated via the gravity-referenced inclination of the instrumented
segment (exact for the segment the sensor is on, a labelled proxy for the club until I2/camera).
The remaining events are *kinematic* (energy/reversal) and are exact from inertials alone.

### A.4 Signal preparation (`FusedStreams` v2)

`SegmentStream` gains the channels the fuser currently discards, all on the same 200 Hz grid:

```cpp
struct SegmentStream {
    SegmentRole role;
    std::vector<QQuaternion> qAnat;     // as today
    std::vector<QVector3D>   gyroDps;   // body-frame, lerped from ImuSample
    std::vector<QVector3D>   accelG;    // body-frame, lerped from ImuSample
};
```

Derived per segment (computed once, shared by all detectors):

- **Energy envelope** `Ω(t) = ‖gyro(t)‖` → zero-phase Butterworth LP ≈ 10 Hz.
- **World-frame gyro** `g_w(t) = qAnat(t) · gyro(t) · qAnat(t)⁻¹` (quaternion rotation, never Euler).
- **Swing-plane normal** `n̂`: principal eigenvector of `Σ g_w·g_wᵀ` accumulated over
  `[impact − 300 ms, impact − 30 ms]` (the downswing is near-planar and dominates the energy);
  sign-fixed so the mean projection is positive.
- **Signed swing-plane rate** `r(t) = dot(g_w(t), n̂)` — positive = downswing direction.
- **Inclination** `θ(t) = asin(dot(qAnat(t)·ŷ_seg, ẑ_world))` — segment long-axis angle above
  horizontal. Gravity-referenced ⇒ immune to the 6-axis yaw drift (inclination needs no re-zero).
- **Pelvis/thorax signed axial rate**: `dot(gyro(t), â_long)` with `â_long` the anatomical long
  axis in the sensor frame — a dot product, no differentiation.
- **Stillness predicate** `still(t)`: `Ω(t) < θ_still` (≈ 15 °/s) **and** `|‖accel(t)‖ − 1| < 0.08 g`,
  required across *all* bound segments.

All event instants get **sub-grid refinement**: parabolic interpolation through the three samples
around a zero-crossing/peak (the 200 Hz grid is 5 ms; the parabola brings events to ~1 ms).

### A.5 Detectors, in search order

Duration priors below are from the §6 literature values (backswing ~1.16 s, downswing ~0.32 s,
follow-through ~0.67 s), padded generously; each gate also shapes the event's confidence
(log-normal likelihood × signal margin, clamped to [0,1]).

**1. Top (P4) — backward from impact.** Find the *downswing run*: the maximal interval ending at
impact where `r(t) > 0` and `Ω(t)` above a low floor. `Top` = the zero-crossing of `r` at the start
of that run. Gate: `impact − top ∈ [180, 600] ms`. This is exactly "the rotation about the swing
plane reverses" — robust to wrist re-hinge, independent of Address.

**2. Transition — pelvis reversal before Top.** Nearest zero-crossing of the pelvis signed axial
rate in `[Top − 250 ms, Top + 80 ms]`, requiring the post-crossing sign to match the downswing.
No pelvis IMU ⇒ event omitted (do not synthesize from Top). When present, `Transition ≤ Top`
ordering is also the kinematic-sequence sanity check (pelvis leads).

**3. Takeaway (≈P2) — back-chain from Top.** Walk backward from Top while `Ω_hand(t) > θ_low`
(hysteresis: `θ_low = max(0.08·Ω_peak, 15 °/s)`), tolerating dips shorter than 120 ms (takeaways
are slow). The chain ends at the first dip below `θ_low` sustained ≥ 150 ms; `Takeaway` = the rise
out of that dip. Gate: `Top − Takeaway ∈ [500, 1800] ms`. Because the walk starts inside the
backswing, waggles (which are separated from the swing by a quiet beat) cannot capture it.

**4. Address (P1) — stillness search before Takeaway.** Continue backward from Takeaway for the
last interval of ≥ 300 ms where `still(t)` holds; `Address` = the **end** of that interval. If no
such interval exists in the window (continuous waggle), `Address = Takeaway` at conf 0.3. This is
also where the metric reference frame is re-anchored (unchanged from §6: *not* frame 0).

**5. Geometric checkpoints.** `MidBackswing` (P3): forearm `θ` crossing 0° upward in
(Takeaway, Top). `Downswing` (P5): crossing 0° downward in (Top, Impact). `Delivery` (P6): club
shaft `θ` crossing 0° in (Downswing, Impact) — club IMU/camera only; until then a hand-orientation
proxy emitted at conf ≤ 0.4 and labelled as a proxy. `Release` (P8) / `FollowThrough` (P9): first /
second forearm crossings after Impact.

**6. MaxSpeed.** `argmax Ω_hand` over `[Top, Impact + 50 ms]` — diagnostically valuable on its own
(early peak = casting; the hands peak just before a well-sequenced impact) and a free input to the
kinematic-sequence metric.

**7. Finish (P10) — forward from impact.** First `t > Impact + 200 ms` where `still(t)` (relaxed:
`θ_finish ≈ 30 °/s`) holds sustained ≥ 250 ms; `Finish` = the start of that interval. Gate:
`Finish − Impact ∈ [400, 2000] ms`. If the window ends first, emit `Finish = grid.back()` at
conf 0.2 — visibly a clamp, never a claim.

**Multi-segment voting.** Hand-chain detectors run on `LeadHand` and `LeadForearm` when both are
bound: agreement within 40 ms boosts conf and averages the instants; disagreement prefers the hand
and lowers conf. Thorax, when bound, cross-checks Top (thorax reversal within ±60 ms).

### A.6 Swing start/end — logical truncation of the window

The frozen `SwingWindow` itself is never trimmed (it is a zero-copy view over ring memory; the 5 s
capture contract is untouched). Truncation is **metadata** consumed downstream:

```cpp
struct Segmentation {
    std::vector<PhaseEvent> events;          // the ladder above
    int64_t swingStartUs = 0;                // Address − 250 ms pad, clamped to coverage
    int64_t swingEndUs   = 0;                // Finish  + 250 ms pad, clamped to coverage
    float   conf         = 0.0f;             // min conf over {Address, Top, Impact, Finish}
};
// v2 API (replaces the v1 signature):
static Segmentation segment(const FusedStreams&, int64_t impactUs, const SegmentationConfig&);
```

Consumers:

- ~~**`SwingExporter`** trims the MP4 encode to `[swingStartUs, swingEndUs]`~~ **Dropped
  (product decision, 2026-06-11): the saved artifact preserves every captured frame — a wrong
  Address/Finish on a real swing would clip frames irrecoverably (the ring is freed after the
  shot). Truncation applies to playback only: replay span, metric grids, and the analyzer's
  heavy-stage scan.** Raw IMU streams in `swing.json` stay full-window (useful for re-running
  segmentation offline).
- **`ShotProcessor` replay** starts at `swingStartUs` and ends at `swingEndUs`.
- **`MetricExtractor`** restricts the metric `TimeGrid` to the truncated span, so every graph spans
  address → finish, not the raw ring.
- **Free metrics:** `backswingMs = Top − Takeaway`, `downswingMs = Impact − Top`,
  `tempoRatio = backswing/downswing` (tour ≈ 3:1) join the catalog with no extra computation.

**Sequencing change.** Today analysis ∥ export launch together and never share results. v2 runs
segmentation as a cheap **pre-stage on the worker before both heavy stages**: `ImuVisionFuser::fuse`
+ `PhaseSegmenter::segment` cost ~milliseconds on a 1000-sample grid. Simplest concrete shape:
`ShotProcessor` runs the segmentation synchronously-on-worker first (a third small QtConcurrent
stage whose future gates the other two), passes the `Segmentation` into both `ShotAnalysisJob` and
`SwingExportJob` as a value, and the analyzer/exporter remain pure const readers. Failure ⇒ both
jobs receive the full-window bounds (today's behaviour) and the events list from the v1-equivalent
fallback.

**Post-roll must grow.** With `kPostRoll* = 500 ms` the finish is truncated by construction
(follow-through ~0.67 s + decay-to-still). Raise the auto-detector post-rolls (`kPostRollImuMs`,
`kPostRollAcousticMs`, …) to **1250 ms**. Budget check: impact then sits ~3.75 s into the 5 s ring,
leaving ~3.75 s pre-impact for address + backswing (~2.5 s typical) — comfortable. Manual-trigger
post-roll can stay 500 ms (the user presses it after the swing anyway; impact is back-dated).

### A.7 Persistence

Additive to `swing.json` (`pinpoint.swing/2`, additive policy — no schema bump):

```json
"analysis": {
  "phases": [ { "phase": 2, "t_us": ..., "conf": 0.91, "segment": "LeadHand" }, ... ],
  "segmentation": { "swingStartUs": ..., "swingEndUs": ..., "conf": 0.84, "version": 2 }
}
```

`phases[]` keeps its int encoding (append-only enum). New optional `segment` provenance field.
Reload (`SwingDocReader`) treats a missing `segmentation` block as full-window bounds.

### A.8 Validation

- **Synthetic-swing unit tests** (existing `src/Analysis/tests` pattern): a parameterized generator
  composing quaternion trajectories per phase with consistent finite-difference gyro; assert every
  event within tolerance (±10 ms kinematic, ±25 ms geometric). Adversarial cases: waggle + regrip
  injection before takeaway, truncated finish, missing pelvis, hand-only, forearm-only, continuous
  pre-shot motion, 100 Hz vs 200 Hz grids.
- **Golden captures:** the pending hardware-verification session records N real swings; hand-label
  events from video frames and regression-test (same harness as the detector goldens).
- **Telemetry sanity:** log per-shot `(Top−Takeaway)/(Impact−Top)` — the tempo-ratio distribution
  centring near 3:1 is a cheap field check that Top and Takeaway are landing where they should.

### A.9 Deferred

- Learned event detector (SwingNet-style heads on license-clean self-captured data) for the
  camera-geometric P-positions; the inertial ladder above remains the always-available base.
- ~~Camera refinement of P2/P6/P8 via shaft-line fitting (`HoughLinesP` in a wrist-anchored ROI)
  once the M2 ViTPose offline path lands.~~ **Superseded by the v3 addendum** — `ShaftTracker`
  shipped a far stronger signal than the speculative Hough fit (smoothed, unwrapped, IMU-bridged
  θ(t) with per-sample confidence), so the refinement is specified there.
- Club IMU (I2) upgrading `Delivery`/`Release` from proxy to exact.
- Per-athlete auto-tuning of thresholds/priors from accumulated shot history.

### C.1 Two-pass architecture

```
ShotProcessor pre-stage (worker, ~ms):
  fuse (IMU-only) → PASS 1: v2 inertial ladder (A.5 verbatim)
                  → Segmentation { events, swingStartUs, swingEndUs, conf }
                  → value-copied into ShotAnalysisJob + SwingExportJob
        ├─► SwingExporter   encodes the FULL window (export trim dropped — see A.6 note)
        └─► Analyzer worker:
              fuse → PASS 1 events (recomputed, cheap, identical)
                   → PoseRunner   over [swingStartUs − pad, swingEndUs + pad]   ← NEW
                   → ShaftTracker over the same bounds                          ← NEW
                   → PASS 2: shaft refinement of the event ladder (§C.3)        ← NEW
                   → MetricExtractor with the REFINED events                    ← moved
                   → score / faults / persistence
```

- **Pass 1** is v2's A.4 signal preparation + A.5 detectors, unchanged and still the only input to
  the export/replay truncation (the exporter cannot wait for the heavy stages). `pad = 150 ms` on
  each side covers pass-1 timing error without giving back the truncation win.
- **Heavy-stage bounding** replaces today's behaviour where `PoseRunner` samples the whole 5 s
  window and `ShaftTracker` detects on every frame inside pose coverage. Expected effect: the
  scanned span drops from 5 s to (Address − pad … Finish + pad) ≈ **2.2–3.2 s typical** — roughly
  **2× fewer pose inferences and shaft detections**; the CPU-only pose tier (10–30 s today)
  benefits proportionally. The dense zone around impact sits inside the span by construction.
  `ShaftTracker`'s ŝ_hand calibration also improves for free: its "slow, confident frames" now
  start at a *correct* Address instead of v1's waggle-polluted one.
- **`MetricExtractor` moves after pass 2** (today it runs before the camera stages), so every
  phase-anchored metric — including `impactShaftLean` — reads the refined instants. Cost: none
  (extraction is milliseconds); the analyzer's stage order changes, not its API.
- When **no face-on camera** ran, pass 2 and the bounding are skipped and v3 degrades to exactly
  v2. When **no IMU** is bound, see §C.4.

### C.2 What the shaft can and cannot measure

The shaft's image angle θ is measured in the face-on image plane (y-down; unwrapped over the
swing). The P-system's geometric club checkpoints — P2/P6/P8, "shaft parallel to the ground" —
occur when the club points down the target line, i.e. **in-plane and horizontal in the face-on
view**: exactly where the face-on θ is most accurate (maximum visible length, no foreshortening).
These are the events the shaft measures *better than any other sensor we have*.

The converse: at the **top** of a full swing the shaft points toward/away from the camera; L(t)
collapses and the tracker itself suppresses θ there (wedge/foreshortening handling, IMU bridging).
So v3 deliberately does **not** make Top a shaft event — Top stays inertial (v2 A.5.1), with the
shaft contributing only a *conditional* cross-check (§C.3). Any design that reads Top from vision
θ̇ would work on half-swings and silently fail on full swings — the wrong failure mode.

Crossing convention: "shaft horizontal" ⇔ `θ ≡ 0 (mod π)`. Since θ is unwrapped and RTS-smoothed,
each crossing is located by linear interpolation between the two bracketing samples (60 fps grid
→ ~2–4 ms effective resolution; the geometric events do not need the 1 ms of the inertial
parabolic refinement).

### C.3 Pass 2 — shaft refinement rules

Pass 2 runs only when `shaft.valid` (the B.8 coverage gate) **and**, when an IMU channel was
fused, `imuVisionCorr ≥ 0.5` (a track that disagrees with the gyro that badly refines nothing).
Each rule below also requires the bracketing samples to be `Measured` (full conf) or `ImuBridged`
(conf × 0.7); crossings that exist only in `Coasted` spans are not events — degrade, never
fabricate.

| Event | v2 source | v3 refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `ShaftParallelBack` (12, **new**) | — (v2 had no geometric P2) | First `θ ≡ 0 (mod π)` crossing in (Takeaway, Top). The P-system P2 proper; `Takeaway` (1) remains the *kinematic* motion-onset event — they are different instants and both are wanted. |
| `Delivery` (9) | hand-orientation proxy, conf ≤ 0.4 | Last `θ ≡ 0 (mod π)` crossing in (Top, Impact) — **measured**, conf from sample conf. The proxy is emitted only when pass 2 is skipped. |
| `Release` (6) | forearm inclination crossing | First `θ ≡ 0 (mod π)` crossing in (Impact, Impact + 400 ms). Forearm rule stays as the no-shaft fallback. |
| `MaxSpeed` (10) | argmax hand \|gyro\| envelope | argmax of `θ̇·L` over [Top, Impact + 50 ms] — a *clubhead*-speed proxy measured at the club, not a hand proxy. Hand-gyro version stays as fallback. |
| `Top` (2) | inertial zero-crossing | Cross-check only: if the θ̇ zero-crossing nearest pass-1 Top sits within ±40 ms **and** local samples are `Measured` with L above ~60 % of its running median (no foreshortening collapse), average the instants and boost conf — the same A.5 multi-segment voting rule with the club as one more voter. Otherwise leave Top untouched. |
| `Impact` (5) | hard anchor | Untouched. (Head-trace-meets-ball validation stays deferred — the teed-ball position is not yet plumbed into the job.) |

Refined events obey v2's A.2.5 monotone-chain rule unchanged: a refinement that would violate
ordering is dropped (lower conf loses), never reordered. Provenance (`segment` field, v2 A.7)
gains the value `"Club"`. Telemetry: log the pass1→pass2 delta for `Delivery`/`Release` per shot —
the two systems measuring the same physical instants independently is a free cross-validation of
*both* (a drifting delta flags whichever is lying, which is exactly what S5 hardware verification
wants to know).

### C.4 Vision-only fallback ladder (no IMU bound)

When `FusedStreams` has no hand/forearm stream, pass 1 emits v2's 3-event clamp fallback and —
critically — **no usable swing bounds**, so the heavy stages run full-window (there is nothing
cheap to bound them with; that is accepted, not worked around). After `ShaftTracker`, if the track
is valid, run the *vision ladder*: the pass-1 detector structure (A.5) re-instanced with vision
signals — `|θ̇|` as the energy envelope (zero-phase filtered), θ̇ sign reversal for Top, back-chain
hysteresis for Takeaway, hand-keypoint stillness (pose2d) for Address, decay for Finish (window
permitting). Differences from the inertial ladder, stated honestly:

- conf capped at **0.6** for every event (60 fps grid, no accelerometer stillness test, single
  modality);
- `Finish` is usually clamped (the post-roll growth of A.6 helps but the vision envelope decays
  slower than gyro quiet);
- the **export is not trimmed** in this mode — the exporter cannot wait for the heavy stages, and
  trimming the replay/metric grids (which *can* use the late events) while shipping a full-length
  MP4 is the right asymmetry, not a bug.

This turns camera-only Swing sessions from "no segmentation at all" into a real, labelled,
lower-confidence ladder — and it costs nothing when IMUs are present.

### C.5 Contracts & persistence deltas

- `Phase` enum append-only: `ShaftParallelBack = 12` joins v2's 8–11. The reload switch keeps
  matching on raw ints.
- `Segmentation` (v2 A.6 struct) gains `int version` (2 = inertial only, 3 = shaft-refined) and
  rides `SwingAnalysis` so the doc writer persists it; reload treats a missing block as
  full-window bounds exactly as v2 specified.
- `ShotAnalysisJob`/`SwingExportJob` carry the pass-1 `Segmentation` by value (v2 A.6 sequencing);
  `ShotAnalysisRunnerOptions` gains the scan bounds for `PoseRunner`; `ShaftTracker` takes its
  span from the same bounds instead of deriving it from Address/Finish events (same meaning,
  better numbers).
- Post-roll growth to 1250 ms (v2 A.6) is **load-bearing for v3 too**: `Release` needs
  Impact + 400 ms of shaft track and `Finish` needs decay-to-still; both are physically truncated
  at today's 500 ms.

### C.6 Validation deltas

On top of v2 A.8: the synthetic-swing generator gains a synthetic shaft track (θ/θ̇/L with
foreshortening collapse at Top, blur-wedge σ growth in the downswing, Coasted gaps) so pass 2 is
unit-tested against ground truth, including the must-not-fire cases (invalid track, low
`imuVisionCorr`, Coasted-only crossings, Top collapse). Golden captures from the S5 hardware
session double as segmentation goldens: hand-label P2/P6/P8 from video and regression-test both
the inertial proxies and the shaft measurements against the same labels.

## Addendum — Club shaft detection (`ShaftTracker`, hand-anchored)

> **Status:** Design addendum (proposal) · **Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Grounded against:** `main` @ `474a6ba`

> Makes the deferred "club/ball (deferred)" line of Algorithms §1 concrete for the **face-on camera**,

>
> **Implementation plan:** [`docs/implementation/shaft_tracker_impl.md`](../implementation/shaft_tracker_impl.md)
> (stages S0–S5: decode/pose → math core → track assembly → analyzer/persistence → replay overlay → hardware tuning).

### B.1 Scope & payoff

**In scope (MVP):** per-frame 2D shaft line (image angle θ, visible length L, grip + clubhead image
points) from the face-on camera, temporally associated, smoothed, and IMU-bridged. **Out of scope
(deferred):** DTL-camera shaft (different geometry, heavy foreshortening), clubface angle, learned
keypoint models, full 3D shaft lift.

What it unlocks, in priority order:

1. **Segmentation v2 upgrades** — `Delivery` (P6) and `Release` (P8) move from hand-proxy
   (conf ≤ 0.4) to *measured* shaft-parallel events; `Top` gains a vision cross-check.
2. **Shaft lean at impact** — hands-ahead/behind lean toward the target is a *face-on* metric,
   directly readable from θ at the impact frame. One of the highest-value coaching numbers.
3. **Clubhead trace** — the classic swing-arc overlay for replay (head point per frame), plus a
   clubhead-speed *proxy* (`θ̇·L`), upgrading to real m/s once C1 ground-plane calibration lands.
4. **Camera↔IMU temporal alignment** — Algorithms §3 needs a vision speed signal to cross-correlate
   against IMU angular velocity for sub-frame stream alignment; vision θ̇(t) **is** that signal.
   `ShaftTracker` therefore also unblocks the fusion layer's "non-optional" alignment step.
5. **Impact validation** — the head trace meeting the teed-ball position cross-checks the arbiter's
   impact timestamp to ±1 frame.

### B.2 Geometry, anchors, and priors

**The anchor.** From the ViTPose-wholebody output (133 channels — already emitted, currently
discarded above channel 16 at `pose_estimator_vitpose.cpp:246`): both hands' 21-keypoint sets
(channels 91–111 left, 112–132 right) give per-hand knuckle centroids; fall back to the COCO wrists
when hand confidence is low. Two anchor products:

- **Grip point `g`** = midpoint of the two hand centroids (wrist midpoint + a fixed offset along
  the forearm direction as fallback). Expected jitter ±3–5 px.
- **Grip direction prior `d̂`** = `normalize(trailHand − leadHand)` — the trail hand grips *below*
  the lead hand, so the inter-hand vector points down-shaft. Worth ±15–20°, available every frame,
  and it resolves which side of `g` the shaft is on for free.

**The IMU prior — the strongest one.** Once gripped, the shaft direction is **constant in the
lead-hand sensor frame**: a fixed unit vector `ŝ_hand`. With a lead-hand IMU bound,
`ŝ_world(t) = q_anat(t)·ŝ_hand·q_anat(t)⁻¹` predicts the shaft direction at 200 Hz — including
through frames where vision is hopeless (peak blur). `ŝ_hand` is **auto-calibrated per shot**
(re-gripping moves it, so never persist it): over the high-confidence slow frames
(Address→Takeaway), fit the 2-DOF unit vector minimizing `Σ wrap(θ_pred(ŝ) − θ_meas)²` — coarse
5° spherical grid then Gauss-Newton. Projection is orthographic until C1 intrinsics exist (fine
for a prior; exact with `K`). The fit residual doubles as the channel's measurement noise. A
lead-*forearm*-only IMU is a weaker substitute (the wrist hinge moves between forearm and shaft):
use it as a loose prior in slow phases only, never as a filter measurement.

**Phase priors** (from segmentation v2): per-phase expected θ ranges (down toward the ball at
Address/Impact, along the target line at Top…) and expected angular velocity (≲ 200 °/s in the
takeaway, up to ~1700–2500 °/s into impact — driver clubhead ~35 m/s over a ~1.15 m shaft ≈
30 rad/s). These scale search windows and gate confidence; they never replace measurement.

**Appearance.** At typical face-on framing (golfer ~500 px tall ⇒ ~270 px/m), a 9–15 mm shaft
images at **2–6 px wide**, tapering tip-ward — a *ridge* (thin line), not an edge pair to a
detector's eye. Steel shafts ride bright (specular highlight); graphite rides dark. Both polarities
are handled and the winner is **locked for the clip** (the club doesn't change mid-swing).

### B.3 Per-frame detection — the anchored radial transform

The core algorithm is a Radon-style transform restricted to **rays from the anchor**: a shaft
through `g` is a 1-D peak in angle space. Pipeline per frame (luma only — the Y plane is directly
addressable in NV12/YUV420P without color conversion; Bayer uses the green channel; BGRA converts):

1. **ROI** = disc of radius `R_max ≈ 1.25 · L_club · pxPerM` around `g`, clamped to the image.
   `L_club` from a new `ShotAnalysisJob::clubLengthM` (default 1.12 m driver until the club field
   is real); `pxPerM` from C1 calibration when present, else from the subject's pose bounding-box
   height vs an assumed stature (prior-quality scale is fine — it only sizes a search region).
2. **Ridge response** (Cartesian, before any resampling): morphological top-hat *and* black-hat
   with a ~7 px kernel — cheap, isotropic thin-structure responses for bright and dark shafts
   respectively (core `imgproc` only; no `ximgproc`/contrib dependency). Threshold adaptively from
   the ROI's noise MAD.
3. **Polar resample** the response map about `g` (`cv::warpPolar`, ~0.5°/bin × 1 px/bin in ρ):
   a line through `g` becomes a **vertical stripe** at constant θ.
4. **Angular score** `S(θ)` per column over `ρ ∈ [ρ_min, ρ_vis]`, with `ρ_min ≈ 1.5` hand-widths
   (skips grip/glove clutter). Score = (mean ridge strength) × (**coverage** = fraction of ρ bins
   supra-threshold). The coverage term is what makes body-crossing benign: a ray crossing the
   torso loses contrast mid-ρ but keeps it on both sides, scoring far above clutter rays.
5. **Clutter masks**: zero `S(θ)` within ±12° of the image directions `g→elbow` (both arms — the
   forearm is itself a radial ridge into the anchor and is the dominant false positive); the
   inter-hand prior `d̂` and the IMU/temporal predictions instead *weight* `S(θ)` multiplicatively
   (soft, never hard-gating a measurement with a prior).
6. **Candidates**: top-K (K ≤ 5) peaks of `S(θ)` after non-max suppression, each refined to
   sub-bin by parabolic interpolation, each with a visible extent: the longest supra-threshold run
   along ρ gives `L(t)` and its terminus seeds the **clubhead** estimate (the head is a compact
   blob terminating the ridge — refine by local blob centroid).

The anchored transform inherently rejects the classic false positives that kill plain
Hough/LSD on golf footage: the **shaft's ground shadow** (a strong line, but through the
*clubhead*, not through `g`), **alignment sticks** and mat edges (not radial through `g`), and it
never suffers Hough's 180° direction ambiguity (ρ is integrated on one side of `g` only).

**Anchor-error tolerance.** The true line misses the wrist midpoint by up to ~10 px (grip is below
the hands; pose jitters). Two cheap fixes: score over a 3×3 grid of anchor perturbations and keep
the best (the polar warp is the only re-done step), and after candidate selection re-fit the line
by total-least-squares over its supporting ridge pixels, letting `g` move to the fitted line's
proximal end.

### B.4 Motion blur — read the wedge, don't fight it

Near impact the shaft sweeps `ω·t_exp` degrees during the exposure (at 2000 °/s and 4 ms ⇒ 8°;
1/60 s rolling exposure ⇒ 30°+). The shaft then images not as a line but a **fan/wedge centered on
`g`** — which in `S(θ)` is a *plateau*, not a peak. This is signal, not noise:

- The plateau **centroid** is the shaft angle at **mid-exposure** (uniform-sweep assumption) — take
  it as `θ_meas` with `R` inflated by the plateau half-width.
- The plateau **width** is a direct measurement of `ω·t_exp` — cross-checkable against the IMU
  channel, and a per-camera exposure-time estimate falls out (useful metadata we have no other
  source for).
- The **proximal shaft barely blurs** (rotation is about a point near the hands: image velocity
  grows linearly with ρ), so coverage near `ρ_min` survives every frame. Weight `S(θ)` toward
  proximal ρ in high-ω phases.
- Frames where even the wedge drowns (very fast + low contrast): emit **no measurement**. The
  filter coasts on the IMU channel — never fabricate (layer-4 discipline).

**Rolling shutter** (consumer webcams): row-sequential exposure shears a fast near-vertical shaft —
the imaged "line" genuinely bends. The proximal-weighted anchored fit reports the grip-side
tangent (the slow, unsheared part), which is exactly the part shaft-lean and P6/P8 need; the
clubhead point carries a `rollingShutter` flag near impact rather than a pretend-straight fit.
Industrial global-shutter cameras (Aravis/Spinnaker) are immune. **Genuine shaft flex** (5–10 cm
lead-deflection at impact) is the same story: report the proximal tangent as θ and the *measured*
head blob as the head — never force collinearity at high ω.

### B.5 Temporal association & smoothing

Per-frame argmax + gating is not enough when a clutter ridge outscores the shaft in scattered
frames. Three stages, matching the design's layer-4 philosophy:

1. **Association — Viterbi over candidate sets.** Nodes = the K candidates per frame (plus a
   "missing" node); node cost `−log score`; transition cost
   `((θ_{t+1} − θ_t − θ̇_pred·Δt)/σ_trans)²` with `θ̇_pred` from the IMU channel when calibrated
   (else finite-difference prediction), plus an `ΔL` smoothness term. O(N·K²) over ~300 frames —
   microseconds. Output: one consistent raw track with outliers and dropouts resolved globally,
   not greedily.
2. **Unwrap** θ along the selected track (the swing sweeps ~300° of image angle; the track is
   continuous by construction, so unwrapping is trivial accumulation).
3. **Filter + smooth.** Constant-acceleration KF on `[θ, θ̇, θ̈]` (white-noise jerk, clubhead-grade
   PSD per the layer-4 per-joint rule) with **two measurement channels**: vision θ (R from wedge
   width × score) and IMU `θ_imu` (R from the `ŝ_hand` fit residual; only when a lead-hand IMU is
   bound and calibration converged). Predict-only when both are absent. Then the
   **Rauch–Tung–Striebel backward pass** over the whole window — offline, zero lag at impact.
   Separate light 1-D KFs smooth `L(t)` and the head point. Quaternions are untouched here — θ is
   a genuine 2-D image-plane scalar, which the quaternions-only rule explicitly permits (it bans
   Euler *intermediates for 3-D rotation*, not image angles).

A final consistency pass clamps physically impossible residue: `|θ̇|` capped by phase prior ×2,
`L(t)` continuity vs the IMU-predicted foreshortening profile `L_club·cos(φ(t))` (the IMU knows
the out-of-plane angle φ — when the shaft points near the camera, L collapses, the angle becomes
ill-conditioned, and confidence is driven down *by geometry*, not by noise heuristics).

### B.6 Outputs

```cpp
struct ShaftSample2D {
    int64_t t_us;            // frame mid-exposure estimate
    QPointF gripPx, headPx;  // image px (face-on camera space)
    double  thetaRad;        // unwrapped image angle of the proximal shaft tangent
    double  thetaDotRadS;    // smoothed angular velocity
    double  visibleLenPx;    // supra-threshold ridge extent
    float   conf;            // 0..1
    uint8_t flags;           // Measured | ImuBridged | Coasted | WedgeCentroid | RollingShutter
};
struct ShaftTrack2D { pinpoint::SourceId camera; std::vector<ShaftSample2D> samples; };
```

Consumers: `PhaseSegmenter` v2 (P6/P8 from θ crossing image-horizontal — true horizon once C1
exists), `MetricExtractor` (impact shaft lean, clubhead-speed proxy, swing-arc width), replay
overlay (head trace polyline), fusion layer 3 (θ̇ cross-correlation temporal alignment). The 3-D
`ClubTrack` of the canonical data model is fed from `ShaftTrack2D` + IMU lift later (deferred).
**Persistence:** additive `swing.json` `analysis.club` block — `{camera, samples:[{t_us, theta,
lenPx, gripX, gripY, headX, headY, conf, flags}]}`, downsampled per the existing series rules.

### B.7 Where it runs, and what it costs

Layer 1, alongside `PoseRunner` (the architecture table's `ClubBallTracker` slot, built as
`src/Analysis/shaft_tracker.{h,cpp}` + pure-math core in `shaft_tracker_math.h` — flat dir,
standalone tests in `src/Analysis/tests/`, per the project layout rule). Per frame after pose:
top/black-hat on a ~600² ROI + `warpPolar` + column reductions ≈ **1–2 ms CPU** — two orders of
magnitude under the ViTPose budget, so it changes nothing in the latency picture. The Viterbi +
KF/RTS passes over 300 frames are sub-millisecond. No new dependencies (core OpenCV `imgproc`
only — deliberately no `ximgproc`/contrib, which the system OpenCV may lack).

`ShotAnalysisJob` additions: `clubLengthM` (defaulted), reuse of existing `handedness` (decides
lead/trail hand channels). No EventBuffer changes, no new sources, const-reader contract untouched.

### B.8 Degradation ladder

| Available | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Pose hands + clean frames | Full track, vision-only (IMU channel absent, σ_trans from finite differences) |
| + lead-hand IMU | `ŝ_hand` auto-calib → IMU measurement channel; blur/occlusion bridged at 200 Hz |
| Hands low-conf in some frames | Anchor predicted from smoothed wrist track (layer-4 output); conf-weighted |
| Shaft points at camera (φ→90°) | L collapses; θ measurement suppressed by geometry; IMU carries |
| No usable shaft in ≥ 60% of swing frames | `ShaftTrack2D` marked invalid; consumers fall back (P6/P8 stay hand-proxy; no head trace) — never a half-track presented as whole |

### B.9 Validation

- **Synthetic harness** (standalone test, no app build): render tapered lines over real captured
  background frames with parameterized blur wedge, rolling-shutter shear, polarity, contrast, and
  anchor error; assert θ within 0.5° (slow) / 2° (wedge frames), L within 5%, association survives
  injected alignment-stick clutter.
- **Golden captures**: hand-label shaft endpoints every ~10th frame on the pending
  hardware-verification swings; regression-test track RMS.
- **IMU cross-validation as a health metric**: the per-shot correlation between vision θ̇ and the
  projected hand gyro is computed anyway (temporal alignment); a low correlation flags a bad track
  *in production*, not just in tests.

### B.10 Deferred

- **DTL-camera shaft** (separate geometry: strong foreshortening, golfer-body occlusion is real
  there) — needed for club path / attack angle; design when the DTL pipeline matters (M3).
- **3-D shaft lift**: C1 calibration + `ŝ_hand` + θ → metric 3-D shaft direction; feeds `ClubTrack`.
- **Clubface angle** — not recoverable from shaft geometry; needs a learned head model or a club IMU.
- **Learned shaft/head keypoint model** — still worthwhile eventually for grip-occluded frames and
  DTL, trained on data auto-labelled *by this classical tracker* (it bootstraps its own successor).
- **Club identification** (driver vs iron) from the L statistics + head blob size, feeding the
  currently-stubbed `club` field.

### SwingWindow / EventBuffer data model — the shot analyzer's frozen-window INPUT contract

The analyzer's sole input is a `pinpoint::SwingWindow` (frozen, zero-copy, read-only view of a Paused EventBuffer) plus a value-type `ShotAnalysisJob` resolved on the UI thread. It is handed to `ShotAnalyzer::analyze(const SwingWindow&, const ShotAnalysisJob&)` on a QtConcurrent worker (src/Gui/shot_processor.cpp:244). The window is valid ONLY while the buffer stays Paused; ShotProcessor owns its lifetime and guarantees both workers join before it is destroyed (finishShot/finishNowBlocking), so all reads over ring memory are stable for analyze()'s duration.

READ MODEL. A window is an ordered `std::vector<IndexEntry>` (src/Buffer/types.h:56) covering [start_us, end_us], sorted ascending by timestamp_us across ALL sources combined (TimelineIndex::snapshot, timeline_index.cpp:111). Each IndexEntry = {int64 timestamp_us, SourceId source_id, uint64 source_sequence, uint64 global_sequence, uint32 flags}. To enumerate sources: iterate `window.entries()`, dedup `e.source_id`, and classify via `window.formatOf(id)` — `FormatDescriptor.device` (DeviceKind) tells Camera_* vs IMU_* vs Marker_App, and `std::holds_alternative<ImuFormat>/<CameraFormat>(fd.format)` discriminates the variant. There is NO source-list accessor; the entry list IS the enumeration (this is exactly how startAnalysis classifies sources, shot_processor.cpp:230-240). Per-source entries in timestamp order: `window.entriesFor(SourceId)` (preserves global ascending order, filtered to that source). Payload bytes: `window.payloadOf(const IndexEntry&)` → `SourceRing::ReadHandle{const std::byte* data, size_t bytes, int64 timestamp_us, uint64 generation_snapshot}`; data==nullptr if the slot was overwritten/in-flight (caller MUST skip these). Format: `window.formatOf(id)` → const FormatDescriptor&.

TIMESTAMP MODEL. Single unified timeline: int64 MICROSECONDS in the `steady_clock` domain (EventBuffer::nowMicros, event_buffer.cpp:313). Camera frames (publishFrameToBuffer) and IMU samples are BOTH stamped with nowMicros() at write time (camera_instance.cpp:1485, imu_instance.cpp:280) — software-timestamp sync (SyncSource::SoftwareTimestamp); there is no hardware PTS/trigger. Per-source strict monotonicity is ENFORCED by the merger (MergerState::enforceMonotonicity clamps ts<=last to last+1, event_buffer.cpp:83-89). Cross-source alignment is timestamp-only: the merger reorders within a `reorder_window_us` and the global vector is timestamp-sorted, but there is NO frame-accurate cross-device sync beyond shared steady_clock µs. To align an IMU sample to a camera frame's instant, use `window.interpolateImu(imu_id, target_us, out, sizeof(ImuSample))` (slerps quaternion shortest-arc, lerps accel/gyro; returns false if target_us is outside the [prev,next] bracket for that source).

VIDEO PAYLOAD. CameraFormat carries pixel_format (PixelFormat enum), width, height, fps, max/typical_payload_bytes, plane_strides[4]. Bytes are stored plane-contiguous (plane0 then plane1...) in one slot. Formats actually produced today: NV12 + YUV420P (webcams), BGRA32 (BGR8 industrial), and 8-bit Bayer RG/BG/GR/GB (GenICam). Bayer12/16, MJPEG, H264_NAL are enum-defined but NOT yet exported/decoded. Canonical decode (swing_exporter.cpp:268-294): rawRows = height * rowsNum/rowsDen (3/2 for NV12/I420), stride = plane_strides[0] ? : width*bpp, then zero-copy `cv::Mat(rawRows, width, CV_8UC1, handle.data, stride)` + cvtColor.

IMU PAYLOAD. Fixed 40-byte `pinpoint::ImuSample` (src/Buffer/imu_sample.h): 10 floats — accel_x/y/z (g), gyro_x/y/z (°/s), quat_w/x/y/z (unit quaternion). Already remapped to display/world frame at write time; rotation is quaternion-only. Read alignment-safely via memcpy into a local ImuSample (swing_exporter.cpp:392). schema "imu_sample_v1".

SHOT MARKER. `ShotController::ShotMarker` (src/Gui/shot_controller.h:47), exactly 16 bytes: {uint32 version=1, uint16 source(=ShotController::Source Manual/Imu/Pose/Ball), int16 session_type(SessionController::Type, -1=none), int64 impact_ts_us}. Source = DeviceKind::Marker_App, schema "shot_marker_v1". CRITICAL: the IndexEntry.timestamp_us of the marker entry EQUALS impact_ts_us (shot_controller.cpp:130) — so `window.entriesFor(markerId).front().timestamp_us` locates impact WITHOUT parsing the payload. The job also carries impactUs directly (ShotAnalysisJob.impactUs) and markerSourceId.

**Integration points**

- ShotProcessor::captureWindowAndLaunch (src/Gui/shot_processor.cpp:167) is the producer: pauses the buffer, calls captureSwingWindow(5s), builds replay tracks, then launches analysis ∥ export. The new analyzer is invoked from startAnalysis (shot_processor.cpp:215-249) via QtConcurrent::run capturing the SwingWindow* and the job.
- ShotAnalysisJob (src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.h:34) is the resolved UI-thread context the analyzer receives alongside the window: sessionType, shotSource(int), impactUs, cameraSources (face-on first), imuSources, markerSourceId. Extend THIS struct for any new UI-thread-resolved inputs (e.g. athlete handedness, club).
- ShotAnalysisResult (shot_analyzer.h:47) is consumed by ShotProcessor::maybeJoin → ShotListModel::addShot (shot_processor.cpp:411): score(int 0-100), metrics(QVariantMap of label/value), tracePoints(QVariantList of QPointF). The 0-100 swing score is r.score; richer biomechanics would extend metrics/tracePoints or a new result field.
- SwingExporter::run (src/Export/swing_exporter.cpp) is the parallel consumer of the SAME frozen window and the canonical reference for reading frames (zero-copy cv::Mat wrap + demosaic, lines 268-294) and IMU streams (lines 388-398). The analyzer should mirror these read loops. swing.json it writes (pixelFormat/width/height/demosaic + imu_sample_v1 streams) is the on-disk twin of the window contract.
- BodyPoseAdapter (src/Gui/body_pose_adapter.*) already converts 17 COCO keypoints → per-bone quaternions for live viz; the per-frame pose for biomechanics is NOT in the EventBuffer (no pose source registered) — it comes from CameraInstance pose estimation on live frames, so an offline analyzer would need to re-run pose on decoded frames or have a pose source added.
- CameraInstance::publishFrameToBuffer (src/Gui/camera_instance.cpp:1459) and the imu_instance.cpp:264-282 quaternionUpdated handler are the WRITE sides — they define the exact byte layout (multi-plane contiguous frames; remapped 40-byte ImuSample) the analyzer reads back.

**Constraints to respect**

- Window is valid ONLY while the buffer is Paused. SwingWindow ctor sets EventBuffer::swing_window_live_=true, dtor clears it (swing_window.cpp:38,43). resumeBuffer() and deregisterSource() are hard-blocked while a window is live (swingWindowLive() backstop). The analyzer MUST NOT outlive analyze() return — ShotProcessor joins both workers (finishNowBlocking) before destroying the window.
- analyze() runs on a QtConcurrent WORKER thread, not the UI thread. The job is a value type resolved on the UI thread (cameraSources/imuSources/markerSourceId/impactUs already computed). Do not touch QObjects/Qt GUI from analyze(); read only the const SwingWindow + job.
- payloadOf() can return data==nullptr for any entry (slot overwritten by ring wrap, or gen=odd mid-write). Every read loop MUST null-check handle.data and skip — the exporter does exactly this (swing_exporter.cpp:277, 390). Also check handle.bytes >= expected size before reinterpreting.
- Read IMU samples alignment-safely: memcpy handle.data into a local ImuSample (swing_exporter.cpp:392) — do NOT reinterpret_cast the ring pointer directly except inside the buffer's own interpolateImu (which controls alignment). The ring payload has no guaranteed alignment for float access.
- Cross-source sync is software-timestamp only (steady_clock µs); there is no hardware trigger/PTS. Frames from different cameras are NOT guaranteed sample-locked — align by timestamp_us. Per-source monotonicity is guaranteed (merger clamps), but two sources can share or interleave timestamps freely.
- Video bytes are plane-contiguous in a single slot (plane0, then plane1...). NV12/YUV420P payloads are 3/2 image-height rows; you must reconstruct planes using width/height/plane_strides[0] from CameraFormat. Bayer is single-plane 8-bit needing demosaic (pattern from PixelFormat). Use plane_strides[0] if non-zero else width*bpp.
- Only NV12, YUV420P, BGRA32, and 8-bit Bayer (RG/BG/GR/GB) are actually produced & decodable today. PixelFormat also enumerates Mono8/12/16, Bayer12/16, YUV422/YUYV/UYVY, RGB24/BGR24/RGBA32, MJPEG, H264_NAL — but these are NOT exercised by the current capture pipeline; an analyzer must handle PixelFormat::Unknown / unsupported gracefully.
- Max 16 sources total (EventBuffer::MAX_SOURCES). Ring is 5 s deep per source (window_duration=5000ms); the captured window can be shorter than 5 s if capture started recently or Stop truncated the follow-through.
- The marker source's entry timestamp equals impact_ts_us — but a window could contain the marker with NO surrounding camera/IMU data near impact if those sources stalled; do not assume frames/samples exist exactly at impactUs (bracket and interpolate, handle false from interpolateImu).

**Gaps to fill**

- NO per-frame 2D/3D pose in the buffer. There is no registered pose/keypoint source — COCO keypoints exist only on the live CameraInstance (BodyPoseAdapter consumes them in real time) and are CLEARED on replay. An offline biomechanics analyzer must re-run pose estimation on decoded frames itself, or a new EventBuffer pose source must be added.
- NO ball/club tracking data in the buffer. CameraInstance::ballPresentChanged is signal-only (feeds overlays) and never written to the EventBuffer (per CLAUDE.md 'Ball detection is signal-only'). Club is a hardcoded 'DRIVER' stub. No ball position/velocity, launch, or clubhead-speed data exists as analyzer input.
- NO camera intrinsics / extrinsics / multi-camera calibration in the window. FormatDescriptor carries only pixel_format/width/height/strides — no focal length, principal point, distortion, or stereo/relative pose. 3D triangulation from multi-camera 2D would require calibration data sourced elsewhere (not in SwingWindow).
- NO frame-accurate cross-device hardware sync. Alignment is steady_clock-µs software timestamps only (SyncSource::HardwarePts/HardwareTrigger are placeholder enums, never used). Sub-frame multi-camera 3D reconstruction is limited by software-timestamp jitter and independent camera shutters.
- interpolateImu handles ONE imu_id at a time and only between samples that exist in-window; it has no extrapolation past the first/last sample (returns false). There is no equivalent frame-interpolation helper for video, and no helper to resample multiple sources onto a common time grid — the analyzer must build that itself.
- Unsupported pixel formats in the analyzer path: MJPEG, H264_NAL, and 12/16-bit Bayer are not decoded by the existing demosaic table (swing_exporter.cpp:62) and would arrive as raw bytes the analyzer cannot interpret. Mono8/16, YUV422/YUYV/UYVY, RGB24 are enum members with no current producer/decoder either.
- ShotAnalysisResult is intentionally thin (score + flat QVariantMap metrics + a single QVariantList trace) to match the existing ShotListModel/addShot UI. A full biomechanics output (per-joint angle time series, kinematic sequence, 3D trajectories) has no carrier field yet — the result struct (or a sidecar artifact like swing.json) needs extending.
- No IMU mounting/anatomical calibration or sensor-to-segment transform is delivered in the window. ImuSample is remapped to a generic display/world frame at write time, but the device→body-segment alignment (anatCalibrated state mentioned in app memory) lives outside the buffer and is not part of this input contract.
- The window's start/end bounds are the snapshot REQUEST window, not actual data extent; the analyzer must derive true temporal coverage from entries() (a source may have zero entries, or coverage shorter than 5 s if Stop truncated the follow-through). impactUs may sit near the end of coverage with little post-impact data.

### Current ShotAnalyzer pipeline + output data model (src/Analysis, src/Gui/shot_processor, SwingExporter, ShotListModel, swing.json)

The "shot analyzer" today is a stub scaffold, not a real biomechanics engine. The architecture is fully wired but every analyzer is a placeholder returning deterministic fake data.

PIPELINE (ShotProcessor, src/Gui/shot_processor.cpp): On ShotController::shotDetected → POSTROLL (500ms, buffer keeps capturing) → pauseBuffer + captureSwingWindow(5s) → PROCESSING: two QtConcurrent::run workers launched over the SAME frozen const SwingWindow (zero-copy, producers stopped while Paused) — startAnalysis() (line 215) runs makeShotAnalyzer(sessionType)->analyze(window, job); startSwingSave() (line 251) runs SwingExporter::run(window, job). Both watched by QFutureWatcher; maybeJoin() (line 395) waits for BOTH outcomes, then ALWAYS calls ShotListModel::addShot() (degrading to hasVideo=false/score 0 on failure), then replays at ¼× only if analysis AND export both succeeded. finishShot() destroys the window and resumes the buffer.

EXTENSION POINT (the place a real analyzer plugs in): the single abstract method `ShotAnalyzer::analyze(const SwingWindow&, const ShotAnalysisJob&) -> ShotAnalysisResult` and the factory `makeShotAnalyzer(int sessionType)`. Replace the four stub classes (SwingStubAnalyzer/WristStubAnalyzer/GrfStubAnalyzer/CoachStubAnalyzer in shot_analyzer.cpp) with real implementations. The worker lambda (shot_processor.cpp:244-248) constructs a fresh analyzer per shot inside the worker thread, so a real analyzer can be heavy/stateful per-call. Inputs available to analyze(): the frozen SwingWindow (all camera frames + IMU samples + shot marker, by SourceId) and a value-type ShotAnalysisJob (sessionType, shotSource, impactUs, face-on-first cameraSources, imuSources, markerSourceId).

CURRENT STUB OUTPUT: score = 40 + (impactUs/1000)%56 (range 40–95); tracePoints = 13-point deterministic pseudo-random normalised (0..1) QPointF curve; metrics = {} for Swing/GRF/Coach, hardcoded 4-key wrist mock for Wrist. ok=true always.

CRITICAL GAP for 3D biomechanics: pose/skeleton data is NOT in the buffer. The SwingWindow contains ONLY raw camera frames (Bayer/YUV/BGR), 40-byte ImuSample records (accel/gyro/quat), and the 16-byte shot marker. Pose keypoints (17 COCO, PoseResult) live ONLY as a live 60Hz QVariantList signal on CameraInstance for QML overlays — never written to EventBuffer, never frozen, never reachable from analyze(). A real analyzer must run pose estimation itself on the frozen camera frames inside analyze(), or a new pose-into-buffer source must be added. There is also NO place to persist 3D skeleton / joint-angle / metric traces: ShotAnalysisResult carries only score+QVariantMap metrics+normalised QPointF tracePoints (all in-memory, lost on app exit — never written to swing.json), and SwingExporter writes only video+IMU+thumbnail. swing.json has no analysis/score/metrics/skeleton block at all.

**Integration points**

- ShotController::triggerShot -> shotDetected(Source, qint64 timestampUs, int sessionType) -> ShotProcessor::onShotDetected (the entry trigger; impact instant is on the EventBuffer steady_clock-us timeline)
- Shot marker: ShotController writes a 16-byte ShotMarker {u32 version, u16 source, i16 session_type, i64 impact_ts_us} into the buffer with IndexEntry.timestamp_us == impact instant (shot_controller.cpp:130). ShotAnalysisJob.markerSourceId points at it so analyze() can locate impact via entriesFor(markerSourceId) without parsing payload.
- ShotProcessor::startAnalysis builds the job: face-on cameras inserted at front of cameraSources (perspective()==CameraInstance::FaceOn); imuSources/markerSourceId discovered by scanning window.formatOf() per distinct source (DeviceKind::Marker_App vs std::holds_alternative<ImuFormat>).
- maybeJoin -> ShotListModel::addShot is the sole path from analyzer output into the QML carousel (PpShotCarousel/PpShotCard read score/tracePoints/metrics/thumbnailSource roles). Wrist metric keys consumed by ScreenWrist.qml:120 metricKeys:["wristAngleTop","impactConditions","trailWristExtension","transition"] — the WristStubAnalyzer's metrics map keys must match these.
- SwingExporter::run runs in parallel and independently writes swing.json + MP4s + thumb.jpg; its SwingExportResult.thumbnailPath becomes the shot's thumbnailSource QUrl. Analyzer and exporter currently DO NOT share results — the analyzer's score/metrics are never written into swing.json.
- Per-session-type split is via makeShotAnalyzer(sessionType) only: Swing 0 / Wrist 1 / GRF 2 / Coach 3 (matching SessionController::Type). Each maps to its own analyzer class — the natural seam for distinct biomechanics pipelines per session type.

**Constraints to respect**

- analyze() runs on a QtConcurrent worker thread while EventBuffer is Paused — it may ONLY read the frozen const SwingWindow (zero-copy) and the value-type job. It must NOT touch AppSettings, controllers, or any UI-thread object (same rule as SwingExportJob). Anything from settings/controllers must be pre-resolved into ShotAnalysisJob on the UI thread (currently the job carries almost nothing — no athlete/handedness/calibration data is forwarded).
- The SwingWindow is destroyed ONLY in finishShot()/finishNowBlocking(), strictly after BOTH workers return. A real analyzer must finish reading window memory before returning — no deferred/async reads holding the SwingWindow pointer past analyze()'s return.
- Analysis and export read the SAME frozen window concurrently as pure readers — a real analyzer must remain a const reader (no mutation of ring memory).
- ShotAnalysisResult shapes are constrained to mirror ShotListModel roles: score is an int 0-100, metrics is QVariantMap of key->{label:QString, value:QString} (display strings, not numbers), tracePoints is a normalised (0..1) QPointF QVariantList. There is no numeric/structured metric channel — values are pre-formatted strings.
- makeShotAnalyzer is called fresh inside the worker lambda per shot (shot_processor.cpp:246) — the analyzer object is short-lived and per-call; any model/weights must be loaded on each analyze() unless the factory is changed to cache.
- The shot ALWAYS lands on the carousel even when analysis fails (maybeJoin degrades to score 0 / empty metrics / empty trace). A real analyzer signalling ok=false suppresses replay but never blocks the shot row.
- Only 8-bit pixel formats are demosaicable by the existing path (BayerRG/BG/GR/GB8, Mono8, BGR24, YUYV/UYVY, NV12, YUV420P). MJPEG, H264_NAL, and 12/16-bit Bayer are unsupported — a real analyzer reading camera frames inherits the same format limitation unless it adds decoders.

**Gaps to fill**

- NO 3D biomechanics anywhere. Every analyzer is a stub returning fake deterministic data (shot_analyzer.cpp). The real per-type analysis pipelines are explicitly flagged as future work in the header comment.
- Pose/skeleton data is NOT available to analyze(). 17 COCO keypoints (PoseResult, pose_estimator_base.h) exist only as a live 60Hz QVariantList signal on CameraInstance for QML overlays — they are never written to the EventBuffer and therefore never appear in the frozen SwingWindow. A real analyzer must either (a) re-run pose estimation on the frozen camera frames inside analyze(), or (b) a new pose-result EventBuffer source must be added so keypoints get frozen alongside frames. No multi-view triangulation / 3D lift exists.
- ShotAnalysisResult is in-memory only — it is NEVER serialised. swing.json (schema pinpoint.swing/1) contains schema/swing/athlete/session/clock/window/streams(+thumbnail) but NO score, metrics, skeleton, joint-angles, or analysis block. Re-opening a saved swing loses all analysis; the carousel score/metrics vanish on app restart. A real analyzer needs an analysis.json (or an additive swing.json block) plus a writer — neither exists.
- ShotAnalysisJob is thin: it carries sessionType/shotSource/impactUs/cameraSources/imuSources/markerSourceId but NO athlete handedness, NO IMU mount/anatomical calibration, NO camera intrinsics/extrinsics/calibration, NO club selection (club is hardcoded "DRIVER" in maybeJoin). Real biomechanics needs camera calibration (for 3D from 2D), IMU-to-segment calibration, and athlete anthropometry — none are plumbed into the job.
- metrics channel is display-strings only (QVariantMap key->{label,value} as formatted QString). There is no numeric metric model, no units, no per-metric confidence — a real analyzer producing e.g. clubhead speed / attack angle would have to stringify and lose machine-readable values.
- tracePoints is a single normalised 2D curve (0..1 QPointF). There is no schema for which signal it represents, no multi-trace support, no time axis in real units — insufficient to carry a real biomechanical time series.
- No scoring model. The 0-100 score is score=40+(impactUs/1000)%56 — a timestamp hash. There is no rubric, no per-metric contribution, no session-type-specific scoring logic.
- SwingWindow exposes interpolateImu() and per-source frame/imu counts but no higher-level helpers (e.g. nearest-entry-to-timestamp across sources, multi-camera time alignment) — a real analyzer must build its own time-alignment over raw IndexEntry timestamps.
- Only one IMU schema (imu_sample_v1, 40-byte accel/gyro/quat) and one camera frame format are decodable; GRF (ground reaction force) session type has no force-plate source in the buffer at all — the GrfStubAnalyzer has no real input to analyze.

### Pose / detection stack (src/Pose, src/Gui/body_pose_adapter, BallDetector) — grounding the shot analyzer

The live detection stack is monocular 2D only. The ONLY estimator actually wired in is PoseEstimatorMoveNet (single-person COCO-17, 2D normalized keypoints + per-keypoint score), running per-frame on a dedicated QThread inside CameraInstance, throttled to ~half camera rate, gated by poseEnabled. Output is published frame-by-frame as CameraInstance.poseKeypoints (QVariantList of {x,y,score}) and consumed live by BodyPoseAdapter, which converts COCO-17 into 10 per-bone parent-local quaternions for a Y-bot 3D viz (cosmetic, image-plane only). PoseEstimatorMediaPipe (BlazePose, 33 landmarks w/ z) and PoseEstimatorViTPose (COCO-WholeBody 133 incl. face/hands/feet) are COMPILED but NEVER instantiated — they are the intended upgrade path. BallDetector is classical OpenCV (Hough + blob on a white HSV mask) restricted to a user ROI, emitting one normalized circle per frame; signal-only, never persisted. CRITICAL GAP for a real shot analyzer: pose/ball results are live-only and NOT stored in the EventBuffer/SwingWindow — ShotAnalyzer::analyze() receives only the frozen raw video+IMU window and has ZERO access to keypoints. There is no club detection, no hand/finger keypoints, no 3D lifting, no multi-camera triangulation, no temporal pose buffering, and MoveNet's plain (distorting) resize loses aspect ratio.\n\nFor the new analyzer you must re-run pose offline over the frozen window (per-source frames in SwingWindow), and either add ViTPose for hands/feet or build a club/wrist model; nothing in the current pipeline gives you 3D biomechanics out of the box.

**Integration points**

- BodyPoseAdapter consumes the pose contract: any QObject exposing poseKeypoints (QVariantList of {x,y,score}) + poseKeypointsChanged(). An offline analyzer could expose the same shape to reuse the COCO-17→quaternion math (src/Gui/body_pose_adapter.cpp:104-135 parseKps/zRot) for a 3D viz of the analyzed swing.
- CameraInstance wires preprocessor→FrameThrottle→{PoseEstimatorMoveNet, BallDetector}, all on dedicated QThreads (camera_instance.cpp:306-371). An offline analyzer can reuse PoseEstimatorBase subclasses directly on frames decoded from SwingWindow without the throttle.
- ShotAnalyzer::analyze(const SwingWindow&, const ShotAnalysisJob&) (src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.h:60) is the funnel the new analyzer implements; ShotAnalysisResult{score, metrics(QVariantMap), tracePoints(QVariantList)} is the output the ShotListModel already consumes — biomechanics metrics should be packed into metrics/tracePoints.
- PersonSegmenter::segment(bgr)->CV_32F mask (src/Pose/person_segmenter.h) is available to clean frames before offline pose (background golfers/clutter).
- mirroredSource convention (per-camera AppSettings camera/isMirrored, default webcam=true) governs left/right handedness in zRot — any new analyzer must honor it for correct golfer side.
- PoseEstimatorViTPose (133-kpt incl. hands/feet) and PoseEstimatorMediaPipe (33-kpt incl. z) are already in the build (HAVE_VITPOSE/HAVE_MEDIAPIPE) and subclass PoseEstimatorBase — drop-in for the analyzer with no new model-loading code needed.

**Constraints to respect**

- Monocular 2D only: MoveNet outputs normalized (x,y,score) in the image plane. No depth, no z. BodyPoseAdapter's zRot produces image-plane (Z-axis) rotation ONLY — the 3D body viz is cosmetic, not a real 3D pose.
- Single person: MoveNet is single-pose; no multi-person handling. PersonSegmenter exists (src/Pose/person_segmenter.h, HAVE_SEGMENTER) to isolate the subject pre-pose but is NOT wired into CameraInstance.
- COCO-17 only via the live path: no wrists-beyond-the-wrist-joint, no fingers, no feet detail, no club. Hands end at PoseJoint::L/RWrist (9/10); ankles at 15/16; no toe/heel.
- No club / shaft / clubhead detection anywhere in src/. BallDetector finds only the (stationary) ball, classically, inside a manual ROI — not a tracked moving object across frames.
- Pose & ball are LIVE-ONLY and ephemeral: results emit per-frame to QML overlays; nothing writes keypoints or ball positions into the EventBuffer. SwingWindow / ShotAnalyzer cannot read them. The analyzer must re-run pose offline over the frozen window.
- Aspect-ratio loss: MoveNet uses plain cv::resize to a square (192/256) with NO letterbox/padding (camera_instance preprocessor delivers full-res; pose_estimator_movenet.cpp:219). Non-square frames are distorted, biasing keypoint geometry. ViTPose (256x192) and BlazePose use proper aspect handling but are unused.
- Throttled rate: FrameThrottle skipFactor=2 → pose runs at ~half camera fps, and only on the freshest frame (drops intermediate frames). Not every captured frame is posed; temporal resolution for fast swing phases is limited live.
- Confidence gating: BodyPoseAdapter requires both hips+both shoulders >= 0.30 to be active and freezes at last pose otherwise — a golfer addressing/at-impact with occluded joints yields stale geometry.
- ORT EP is per-process best-effort (CoreML/CUDA/DirectML/CPU); IntraOpNumThreads=1. CUDA gated on /proc/driver/nvidia/version presence on Linux.

**Gaps to fill**

- No 3D biomechanics: everything is 2D image-plane. No monocular 3D lifting, no multi-view triangulation despite multi-camera capture (face-on + DTL). The two-camera setup is NOT fused — each CameraInstance poses independently; nothing triangulates the two 2D skeletons into 3D.
- No persisted pose/ball timeline: keypoints/ball are not in the EventBuffer, so the frozen SwingWindow has no pose track. The analyzer must DECODE frames from the window and RE-RUN a pose estimator offline (none of this plumbing exists yet).
- No club model at all — no shaft line, clubhead path, face angle, or impact-location detection. Essential for swing metrics; entirely missing.
- No hand/finger/grip keypoints in the live path (COCO-17 stops at wrist). Wrist hinge/cock — central to a wrist-session score — cannot be measured from MoveNet; needs ViTPose-wholebody or a dedicated hand model.
- No feet/ground keypoints from the model (feet hidden in viz). GRF/weight-shift session scoring has no kinematic ground-contact source from pose; only IMU + (future) force data.
- No temporal smoothing/tracking across the swing offline; live path uses per-frame MoveNet + a viz-only slerp. No velocity/acceleration of joints, no swing-phase segmentation (address/top/impact/follow-through).
- No camera intrinsics/extrinsics or calibration data feeding pose — normalized image coords are never converted to metric/world space, so no real angles, distances, or speeds can be derived from pose alone.
- No mapping from PoseResult/keypoints into ShotAnalysisResult — the analyzer→model contract exists but the biomechanics computation (angles, kinematic sequence, 0-100 scoring rubric) is entirely unimplemented (v1 analyzers are stubs).
- Aspect-distortion bug to fix before serious geometry: MoveNet's non-letterboxed square resize must be corrected (or switch to ViTPose) for accurate joint angles.

### Camera calibration & geometry (for metric stereo triangulation from DTL + face-on pair)

There is NO geometric camera calibration in the codebase. No intrinsics (focal length, principal point, distortion), no extrinsics (inter-camera relative pose), no checkerboard/ChArUco/AprilTag solver, no triangulation, no solvePnP/stereoCalibrate/triangulatePoints anywhere (a repo-wide search of *.cpp/*.h/*.qml/*.md/*.py/*.json for cameraMatrix|focalLength|principalPoint|distCoeffs|projectionMatrix|stereoCalibrate|triangulatePoints|solvePnP returned zero hits). What exists is only a coarse semantic/state layer:

1. "Camera calibration wizard" = a pure STUB. src/Gui/CameraCalibrationFlow.qml is a placeholder Item whose own header comment says "The real pipeline and its QML-exposed validity property don't exist yet." Its Start button is hard-disabled (enabled: false). Body text: "Capture a ChArUco target from both cameras to solve the stereo extrinsics. This step isn't available yet." It NEVER navigates and stores NOTHING. It only mirrors the shape (layoutMode/completed()/cancelled()) of the real IMU flow.

2. "is calibrated" for a camera is just a boolean toggle, NOT a geometric solve. cameraFixedInPlace (QVariantMap<cameraKey,bool> in app_settings.h:85) is set by a Settings → Cameras toggle (CamerasPanel.qml:579-630) labelled "FIXED IN PLACE" / "Camera is attached to the wall or immovable." There is no cameraCalibrated property at all — that name does not exist. cameraKey = description + "|" + (serialNumber||id) (camera_manager.cpp:662-665).

3. Perspective enum (CameraInstance::Perspective, camera_instance.h:106): None=0, DownTheLine=1, FaceOn=2, Other=3. NOTE: the task hint "DTL=?" → DTL=1, NOT 2; only FaceOn=2 was given correctly. Stored per-camera in cameraPerspective QVariantMap, restored at connect (camera_manager.cpp:681-686, only applied if p>0). This is a human label used to pick which camera drives the body-viz / which is face-on; it carries NO geometry.

4. isMirrored (CameraInstance, camera_instance.h:85; persisted in cameraIsMirrored QVariantMap, restored camera_manager.cpp:688-690). Used only to flip the sign of the x-component in BodyPoseAdapter's 2D-keypoint→bone-quaternion math (webcam mirrored=true, industrial=false). Not a calibration; a single mirror bit.

5. Time sync is nominal only. cameraSyncEnabled (bool, default true) is stored and shown in CamerasPanel.qml:1907 ("Lock frame timing across all enabled cameras") but is NEVER read by any C++ — no hardware trigger / PTP / genlock enforcement. The real cross-source time base is the EventBuffer monotonic clock: every IndexEntry carries timestamp_us (types.h:57) in EventBuffer::nowMicros() domain (event_buffer.h:185), set at frame arrival. SwingWindow::interpolateImu() (swing_window.h:71) already slerps IMU quaternions to an arbitrary target_us — i.e. per-source temporal interpolation exists, but cross-camera frames are only software-timestamped at capture (webcam mapping latency on macOS is a known multi-ms hazard per EventBuffer merger notes), so sub-frame stereo sync is NOT guaranteed.

IMU side (for contrast, this one IS real): anatomical calibration exists and works. ImuInstance exposes calibrated, anatCalibrated, mountDeviationDeg, mountGravityErrorDeg (imu_instance.h:62-79). q_anat = A * q_raw * M (imu_calibration.h). A two-phase functional wizard (ImuCalibrationFlow.qml: arm-down capture → T-pose/abduction capture, stillness-gated at 15°/s for 2000ms, slerp-averaged) solves A and refines M about the long axis, then validates with a two-part mount gate: mountDeviationDeg ≤ 15° (strap rotation) AND mountGravityErrorDeg ≤ 25° (flip/upside-down). Mount thresholds are the 15°/25° in ImuCalibrationFlow.qml:341. Nominal mounts are fixed constants nominalArmMount()=(0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5) and nominalHandMount() (imu_calibration.h:71-85). IMU calibration is session-lifetime only (not persisted to AppSettings imuCalibration in the live path; QVariantMap exists but the flow stores quats on the instance). So the project already has a working "anatomical/functional calibration" pattern to copy for cameras — but the camera analogue is entirely unbuilt.

The shot analyzer that this feeds is itself a stub: makeShotAnalyzer() returns immediate placeholder score/metrics/trace (shot_analyzer.h:70-73). ShotAnalysisJob already plumbs cameraSources (face-on first) and imuSources SourceIds into the worker (shot_analyzer.h:39-41), and SwingWindow gives zero-copy frozen access to frames per camera + FormatDescriptor (resolution) per source — so the data plumbing for triangulation inputs is present; only the geometry is missing.

**Integration points**

- CameraCalibrationFlow.qml is the pre-cut UI slot for the real flow — it already mirrors ImuCalibrationFlow's host contract (layoutMode/completed()/cancelled()) and is hosted by PpCameraPanel; replacing its stub body with a real ChArUco capture+solve flow needs no host changes.
- CameraInstance is where per-camera intrinsics/extrinsics should live (it already owns perspective, isMirrored, frameWidth/Height, FormatDescriptor) and is the EventBuffer source for that camera — a CameraInstance::calibration() accessor would be the natural read point for the analyzer job.
- AppSettings is the persistence layer: add cameraIntrinsics / cameraExtrinsics QVariantMaps alongside cameraPerspective/cameraIsMirrored/cameraFixedInPlace, keyed by cameraKey, following the existing QVariantMap getter/setter/NOTIFY pattern.
- ShotAnalysisJob is where calibration must be injected: extend it with per-cameraSource intrinsics + a stereo extrinsic (or a world-frame pose per camera) resolved on the UI thread, so the worker can triangulate from the frozen frames.
- makeShotAnalyzer()/ShotAnalyzer::analyze is the consumer: the (currently stub) per-session analyzers would call OpenCV (HAVE_OPENCV is already a build flag used by Pose/Ball) to undistort + triangulate 2D pose keypoints from face-on (perspective==2) and DTL (perspective==1) cameras.
- Pose keypoints are already produced per camera (CameraInstance::poseKeypoints, MoveNet/MediaPipe in src/Pose) — these 2D keypoints are the triangulation correspondences; they're available live and the COCO-17 set is what BodyPoseAdapter consumes.
- imu_calibration.h is the reusable, quaternion-only, header-only, unit-testable pattern to imitate for a camera calibration solver (keep it pure, no UI/AppSettings deps).

**Constraints to respect**

- Hard project rule: all rotation representation must be quaternions (QQuaternion/glm::quat), never Euler angles except for last-moment UI display. Any extrinsic camera pose must be stored/composed as a quaternion + translation, not roll/pitch/yaw.
- EventBuffer producer contract: registerSource/deregisterSource require the buffer paused; the hot write path is lock-free SPSC — do NOT add mutexes. A new calibration data source (if any) must follow the camera/IMU stop-barrier pattern.
- Analysis workers (ShotAnalyzer::analyze) run on a QtConcurrent thread over a FROZEN const SwingWindow and may NOT touch AppSettings or controllers — all calibration data must be resolved on the UI thread into the value-type ShotAnalysisJob before the worker starts (same rule as SwingExportJob).
- cameraKey identity = description + '|' + (serialNumber || id) — any persisted calibration must key on this exact string to survive reconnects (camera_manager.cpp:662-665).
- AppSettings single-shared-instance rule: writes must go through the global AppSettings* passed into managers, never a local AppSettings, or QML bindings won't update.
- cameraSyncEnabled is stored but NEVER enforced in C++ — there is no hardware genlock/trigger/PTP; do not assume frame-synchronous capture across cameras.
- Most webcams report sensorWidthMm/HeightMm = 0 and no focal length; intrinsics cannot be derived from existing CameraCapabilities — they must be measured by a real calibration routine.

**Gaps to fill**

- NO camera intrinsics anywhere: no focal length (px or mm), no principal point, no distortion coefficients, no per-camera 3x3 K matrix. CameraCapabilities has sensorWidthMm/HeightMm but they are typically 0 and there is no focal length field at all.
- NO extrinsics / inter-camera relative pose: no R|t or quaternion+translation between the DTL and face-on cameras, no world origin, no per-camera pose. Metric stereo triangulation is impossible today.
- NO calibration target detector or solver: no checkerboard, no ChArUco, no AprilTag, no OpenCV calibrateCamera/stereoCalibrate/stereoRectify/solvePnP/triangulatePoints — searched repo-wide, zero hits. The 'ChArUco' word appears only in the disabled stub's body text.
- NO scale reference: nothing anchors pixel measurements to metric units (no known target square size, no baseline length, no reference object). A 0-100 swing score needing real velocities/angles in metric space has no length scale.
- NO real camera 'is calibrated' state: cameraFixedInPlace is a wall-mount boolean, not a geometric-validity flag; there is no cameraCalibrated property and no calibration-residual/RMS-reprojection-error quality metric (contrast the IMU's mountDeviationDeg/mountGravityErrorDeg which DO exist).
- NO enforced time synchronization across cameras: cameraSyncEnabled is stored but never acted on; frames are only software-timestamped at arrival (multi-ms jitter possible, esp. macOS), so sub-frame stereo correspondence in time is not guaranteed — a temporal-sync/interpolation step (like SwingWindow::interpolateImu but for cameras) is missing.
- NO persisted camera calibration in AppSettings: there is no cameraIntrinsics/cameraExtrinsics map; the existing imuCalibration QVariantMap is also effectively unused by the live IMU flow (calibration is session-lifetime), so even the persistence convention is unproven for calibration data.
- NO 2D→3D lifting / triangulation utility and NO biomechanics math: shot_analyzer is a stub; there is no code to undistort keypoints, triangulate, fit a 3D skeleton, or fuse the camera-derived 3D with IMU anatomical quaternions.
- TO ADD for metric stereo triangulation: (1) per-camera intrinsics K + distortion (run OpenCV calibrateCamera on a ChArUco capture, store keyed by cameraKey); (2) stereo extrinsics — quaternion R + translation t between face-on(2) and DTL(1), from a shared-target stereoCalibrate, with a known target square size as the SCALE reference; (3) a real CameraCalibrationFlow replacing the stub (target detection, multi-view capture, solve, reprojection-error gate analogous to IMU's mount gate, persist to AppSettings, expose a genuine cameraCalibrated flag on CameraInstance); (4) cross-camera temporal sync/interpolation so the two views correspond at impactUs; (5) inject all of the above into ShotAnalysisJob on the UI thread; (6) an OpenCV undistort+triangulatePoints step in the analyzer to lift the per-camera COCO keypoints into metric 3D, then fuse with IMU anatQuat.

### IMU subsystem as a fusion substrate (src/IMU + src/Gui/imu_instance + src/Gui/imu_manager) — grounding for the new multi-camera + multi-IMU shot analyzer

The IMU substrate delivers ~100 Hz quaternion-only orientation per device into the shared EventBuffer, ready for the frozen-window analyzer. CRITICAL CORRECTION to stale CLAUDE.md notes: orientation is NOT taken from the WT901's native/Euler output. The WT901BLE67 streams a single 20-byte 0x61 combined frame per BLE notification (accel + gyro + device-Euler, all int16 LE, no checksum); the device Euler proved non-rigid (joint axes off 15-50deg, gimbal-locks near pitch=+-90), so orientation is fused LOCALLY from raw gyro+accel via a runtime-selectable Madgwick (default) or ESKF filter in ImuBase::fuseRawImu(). The eulerToQuat() axis-mapping override (Roll->X, Yaw->Y, -Pitch->Z, gated on |pitch|>=85deg) is LEGACY/dead for this hardware and runs only on the old 0x55/0x53 serial path. See src/IMU/wt9011dcl_base.cpp:216 dispatchCombinedPacket() and src/IMU/wt9011dcl_ble.cpp:172.\n\nWRITE PATH: ImuInstance registers one EventBuffer source (DeviceKind::IMU_WitMotion, schema "imu_sample_v1", 100 Hz, 10000us interarrival, 5 s window, SoftwareTimestamp). On every quaternionUpdated it writes a fixed 40-byte pinpoint::ImuSample {accel xyz (g), gyro xyz (deg/s), quat wxyz} via a DirectConnection on the BLE thread (lock-free SPSC), gated on isCapturing(). Both accel AND gyro are axis-remapped at write time to a display/world frame: sensor X->X, sensor Z->Y, -sensor Y->Z (src/Gui/imu_instance.cpp:271-281). The stored quaternion is the RAW fused sensor-body quaternion (NOT remapped, NOT anatomical).\n\nCALIBRATION: Anatomical orientation q_anat = A * q_raw * M (imu_calibration.h) lives ONLY on the live ImuInstance QObject (m_alignA fusion-world->anat-world, m_mountM anat-body->sensor-body, exposed as anatQuat/anatCalibrated/mountDeviationDeg/mountGravityErrorDeg Q_PROPERTYs). M is a fixed strap-enforced nominal (nominalArmMount=(0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5) or nominalHandMount); A is solved so q_anat=identity at the arm-down reference. Driven by ImuCalibrationFlow.qml two-pose flow (arm-down + abduction) calling setNominalCalibration()/refineMountAboutLongAxis(). Device-side CALSW zeroing (zeroToCurrentPose: CALSW 0x0008->0x0004->0x0000) is now vestigial; ORIENT=0x0001 (vertical mount) + AXIS6=0x0001 (6-axis) are still applied on every connect via initializeDevice().\n\nSEGMENT MAPPING: An IMU is bound to a body segment ONLY via appSettings.imuPlacement[deviceId] = 'A'|'B'|'C' (QVariantMap, QSettings key imu/placement), with per-session-type slot->segment labels hardcoded in ScreenSessionWizard.qml:227. Wrist: A=Wrist/forearm, B=Hand, C=Upper arm (optional). Swing/Coach: A=Thorax, B=Lumbar spine, C=T12. GRF: A=Lead thigh, B=Trail thigh, C=Lumbar spine. There is NO club/shaft IMU and no pelvis IMU is wired beyond these labels. This placement map is QML/QSettings-only -- it never reaches C++ analysis.

**Integration points**

- EventBuffer source: ImuInstance::sourceId() (pinpoint::SourceId) is the handle; the analyzer discovers IMU sources from the frozen window by testing std::holds_alternative<ImuFormat>(window.formatOf(id).format) — exactly what ShotProcessor::startAnalysis (src/Gui/shot_processor.cpp:230) and SwingExporter (src/Export/swing_exporter.cpp:371) already do.
- Analyzer entry: makeShotAnalyzer(sessionType)->analyze(const SwingWindow&, const ShotAnalysisJob&) on a QtConcurrent worker (src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.h). v1 ships stubs. The new biomechanics/score code plugs in here per session type.
- Frozen-window read: SwingWindow::entriesFor(sourceId)+payloadOf(entry) (memcpy 40-byte ImuSample) for raw walk, or interpolateImu(sourceId,target_us,...) for time-aligned (impact-relative) sampling. job.impactUs gives the impact instant to align IMU + camera + marker streams.
- Impact location: ShotController writes a 16-byte shot_marker_v1 (DeviceKind::Marker_App) with IndexEntry.timestamp_us = impact instant; job.markerSourceId + window.entriesFor(markerId) locate impact without payload parsing.
- Live anatomical transform / mount-quality gates: ImuInstance::anatQuat, anatCalibrated, mountDeviationDeg, mountGravityErrorDeg, calibrationAngleValid Q_PROPERTYs — usable for live viz (BodyVizView, ArmVizView) but must be snapshotted on the UI thread into the job if the analyzer needs them.
- Segment mapping bridge: AppSettings::imuPlacement() (QVariantMap, key imu/placement) + the ScreenSessionWizard imuRequirements table is the only deviceId->segment source; a C++ resolver on the UI thread would convert {placement[deviceId], serialNumber} into job-side segment roles.
- Per-device serial identity: SourceDescriptor.identifier / FormatDescriptor.device_serial = imuCapabilities.serialNumber (fallback device.id) — the stable key linking a window SourceId back to a placement slot and alias.
- Fusion algorithm selection: ImuManager::setOrientationFilter('Madgwick'|'ESKF') persists to AppSettings (imu/orientationFilter) and pushes to all live instances; affects the quaternion the analyzer will see in stored samples.

**Constraints to respect**

- HARD RULE (CLAUDE.md): rotations are quaternions only, never Euler in computation. ImuSample stores unit quaternion; device Euler is emitted for UI labels only. SwingWindow::interpolateImu already slerps. Any analyzer math must compose via quaternion multiply / slerp.
- Orientation source is LOCAL Madgwick/ESKF fusion of raw gyro+accel, NOT the device quaternion and NOT the device Euler. The CLAUDE.md eulerToQuat axis-mapping note is stale for the WT901BLE67 0x61 path.
- Stored quaternion in ImuSample is the RAW fused sensor-body quaternion. accel and gyro ARE display-frame remapped (X->X, Z->Y, -Y->Z) but the quaternion is NOT — a consumer mixing them must account for this asymmetry.
- EventBuffer producer contract: IMU writes are lock-free SPSC on the BLE thread via DirectConnection; deregister requires buffer paused AND the producer severed first (stop() disconnects quaternionUpdated before deregisterFromBuffer). The analyzer reads a FROZEN window only (const, zero-copy, valid only while buffer Paused).
- Fixed measurement ranges: accel +-16 g (/32768*16), gyro +-2000 deg/s (/32768*2000). Default rate 100 Hz; supported 10/20/50/100/200. WT901BLE67 reports NO magnetometer and NO temperature on the 0x61 frame; 6-axis fusion (no mag) is forced for fast swing dynamics.
- Anatomical calibration q_anat=A*q_raw*M is session-lifetime only and lives on the live ImuInstance QObject. It is destroyed when the instance is, and is never written into the EventBuffer, ShotAnalysisJob, or swing.json export.
- Segment-to-device binding is appSettings.imuPlacement (QVariantMap deviceId->'A'/'B'/'C') consumed only in QML; slot->segment labels are hardcoded per session type in ScreenSessionWizard.qml. No club/shaft or standalone pelvis IMU exists.

**Gaps to fill**

- NO segment/role reaches the analyzer. ShotAnalysisJob carries only bare imuSources (SourceIds). The deviceId->'A'/'B'/'C'->anatomical-segment mapping (appSettings.imuPlacement + ScreenSessionWizard.qml labels) is QML/QSettings-only. The analyzer cannot tell which SourceId is the lead wrist vs hand vs thorax. NEEDED: resolve placement on the UI thread and add a segment field to ShotAnalysisJob (e.g. map<SourceId, SegmentRole>).
- NO anatomical transform is persisted. q_anat = A*q_raw*M (A=alignA, M=mountM) exists only on the live ImuInstance and is never written to the ImuSample, ShotAnalysisJob, or swing.json. The frozen window contains ONLY raw fused sensor-body quaternions. The analyzer cannot compute anatomical/joint angles without A,M. NEEDED: snapshot alignA()/mountM() per source into the job (or extend the buffer schema to imu_sample_v2 / write a sidecar), so the worker can apply A*q_raw*M.
- NO joint-angle / relative-segment math exists in C++. Joint angles are relative rotations between adjacent anatomical segments (e.g. wrist flexion = forearm vs hand) — none of this is implemented. solveSegment/anatQuat are the building blocks but the inter-segment composition lives nowhere on the analysis side.
- NO clubhead-speed pathway. There is no club/shaft IMU and no derivation of clubhead speed from body-segment angular velocity. gyro (deg/s) per segment is available, but the kinematic-chain model to estimate clubhead speed is absent.
- Angular velocity available but under-used: ImuSample stores gyro (deg/s) directly; ImuInstance also derives angularVelocityDps from successive quaternions (UI/stillness gating only). The analyzer would use stored gyro, but note gyro is display-frame remapped while the stored quaternion is not — frame consistency must be handled.
- Timestamp domain: IMU samples use SyncSource::SoftwareTimestamp (BLE-thread nowMicros at packet arrival), not hardware-synced to cameras. Cross-modal (IMU<->camera) alignment at impact relies on a common software clock; sub-frame sync accuracy for biomechanics is unquantified.
- Open design question (per the task): how MANY IMUs and WHERE. Current wiring supports up to 3 slots (A/B/C) per session with fixed labels — Wrist needs forearm+hand (+optional upper arm) for wrist flexion & forearm rotation; Swing/Coach place thorax+lumbar+T12 for shoulder/hip/spine rotation and X-factor; GRF uses lead/trail thigh+lumbar. There is no pelvis-vs-thorax pairing wired for X-factor as distinct from the thorax/lumbar/T12 triple, and no per-segment count enforcement in C++.
- ImuFormat in the descriptor is fixed at 100 Hz / imu_sample_v1; there is no version bump path documented for adding anatomical fields — schema evolution (imu_sample_v2) or a per-source metadata sidecar is an open decision.

### Build, dependencies, math libs, model + data infrastructure (grounding a 3D-biomechanics shot analyzer)

PinPoint Studio is a Qt6/C++20 app built from a single root CMakeLists.txt (1801 lines) using FetchContent for nearly all heavy deps, downloaded/built at configure time. The analyzer skeleton already exists and is wired: ShotProcessor::startAnalysis() builds a value-type ShotAnalysisJob (sessionType, impactUs, cameraSources face-on-first, imuSources, markerSourceId) and runs makeShotAnalyzer(sessionType)->analyze(const SwingWindow&, job) on a QtConcurrent worker concurrently with SwingExporter::run() over the same frozen, paused EventBuffer window. Today makeShotAnalyzer() returns per-session-type STUBS (src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.cpp) producing placeholder score (40-95 derived from impactUs) + deterministic fake trace + canned metrics. The analyzer reads zero-copy from a SwingWindow: 2D-only COCO keypoints are NOT in the window (pose runs live per-frame, results are not buffered), but raw camera frames (payloadOf) and 40-byte ImuSample records (accel g, gyro deg/s, unit quaternion wxyz; interpolateImu() lerps/slerps) ARE. Math/ML inventory: Eigen 3.4.0 (FetchContent, header-only, used by vendored ESKF IMU filter) is the ONLY linear-algebra lib; rotation math elsewhere uses Qt QQuaternion/QVector3D. ONNX Runtime 1.26.0 (prebuilt, per-platform GPU binary) drives all pose models. OpenCV (system/Homebrew, REQUIRE >=3.0) and FFmpeg (pkg-config, GPL+libx264 OK since project is GPLv2+). NO glm, Ceres, g2o, Sophus, or DTW library present. CRITICAL GAP for full 3D analysis: there is no camera intrinsics/extrinsics/calibration, no solvePnP/triangulation/stereo, no multi-view fusion, and the swing.json schema (pinpoint.swing/1) stores video + IMU streams but NO 3D pose, joint angles, or metrics block.

**Integration points**

- src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.cpp — replace SwingStubAnalyzer/WristStubAnalyzer/GrfStubAnalyzer/CoachStubAnalyzer with real implementations; the factory dispatch and interface are stable.
- src/Gui/shot_processor.cpp:215-249 (startAnalysis) — already constructs ShotAnalysisJob and joins the result via m_analysisWatcher (QFutureWatcher<ShotAnalysisResult> at :89); result flows to ShotListModel::addShot(). Extend ShotAnalysisResult + the join to carry 3D pose/joint-angle traces.
- src/Export/swing_exporter.cpp:428-456 — swing.json root is additive; append a 'biomechanics'/'analysis' block (3D pose per frame, joint angles, metrics, score) alongside existing video/imu streams. Schema string 'pinpoint.swing/1' would bump or stay (readers ignore unknown keys).
- ONNX model acquisition: mirror the ViTPose block (CMakeLists.txt:1215-1270) — file(DOWNLOAD) into build/_deps/<model>/, HAVE_<X> + <X>_MODEL_FILE compile defines, POST_BUILD copy to <exe>/models/. Runtime load via the EP cascade in pose_estimator_vitpose.cpp:89-185.
- Eigen is already on the include path (eigen_SOURCE_DIR at CMakeLists.txt:482) and linked transitively via the ESKF filter — a new analyzer can #include <Eigen/Dense> immediately with no CMake change.
- Camera frames for re-running pose offline: SwingWindow::payloadOf() + formatOf() give raw bayer/NV12/YUV420P frames; the exporter's demosaic table (swing_exporter.cpp) shows how to decode them to cv::Mat (handles bayer + NV12/YUV420P; MJPEG/H264/12-16bit bayer unsupported).
- AppSettings athleteLibraryPath + imuCalibration/imuPlacement/imuMountOrientation maps (app_settings.h) — read on the UI thread, pass into the job, for per-athlete anatomical calibration and baseline/scoring reference data.

**Constraints to respect**

- GPLv2+ project (root LICENSE = GPL v2; every source header is GPLv2-or-later). Any new dependency MUST be GPLv2-compatible: MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0/MPL OK; GPLv3-only is NOT (incompatible with the GPLv2 files). Ceres(BSD-3)=OK, g2o(BSD/LGPL mix)=OK, dtaidistance/dtw-cpp(MIT)=OK, Eigen(MPL2)=already in. Bundled FFmpeg+libx264(GPL) is explicitly noted as fine because project is GPLv2+.
- All heavy deps are fetched/built at CMake CONFIGURE time via FetchContent or file(DOWNLOAD): whisper.cpp v1.7.2, libsamplerate 0.2.2, Eigen 3.4.0, ONNX Runtime 1.26.0 (1.20.1 on Intel macOS), ORT-GenAI 0.13.1, espeak-ng 1.52.0. Models via file(DOWNLOAD) from HuggingFace/GitHub into build/_deps/<name>/, then copied POST_BUILD to <exe>/models/ (or .app/Contents/Resources/models on macOS). A new analyzer ONNX model must follow this exact pattern (download+cache+copy+HAVE_X define+filename define).
- ONNX Runtime EP selection is per-platform at CMake time AND runtime: Windows picks gpu/gpu_cuda13/std zip by detected CUDAToolkit major version; Linux picks gpu vs cpu tgz by WITH_CUDA; macOS arm64 always has CoreML, Intel macOS pinned to ORT 1.20.1 CPU. Defines WITH_CUDA/WITH_COREML reach C++ only where supported; DirectML define is NOT set (NuGet discontinued after ORT 1.24 — CUDA covers Windows GPU). At runtime use the try/catch EP cascade + actual GPU probe, NEVER trust #ifdef WITH_CUDA alone (binary may be downloaded on a GPU-less machine).
- GPU story is Vulkan-PREFERRED only for whisper.cpp (GGML_VULKAN if Vulkan SDK found, else CUDA via nvcc, else CPU). ONNX Runtime does NOT use Vulkan — its EPs are CoreML/CUDA/DirectML/CPU. A new pose/biomech ONNX model inherits the ORT (CUDA/CoreML) acceleration path, NOT Vulkan.
- SwingWindow is valid ONLY while the EventBuffer is Paused; payload pointers are dangling after resume(). The analyzer worker MUST finish (joined via QFutureWatcher in ShotProcessor) before the window is destroyed in finishShot()/finishNowBlocking(). Any heavier 3D pipeline must respect this freeze window (currently a 5s trailing ring) or copy data out first.
- analyze() runs on a worker thread and is forbidden from touching AppSettings or controllers — all inputs must be pre-resolved into the value-type ShotAnalysisJob on the UI thread (same rule as SwingExportJob). New per-athlete calibration / model-selection state must be threaded through the job struct.
- Analyzer + exporter run CONCURRENTLY as two QtConcurrent readers of the same const window. Heavy ONNX inference in the analyzer will contend with the exporter's H.264 encode for CPU/GPU — EP/thread budget must be considered (ViTPose sets IntraOpNumThreads(1)).

**Gaps to fill**

- NO camera calibration whatsoever: no intrinsics (focal length/principal point/distortion), no extrinsics (per-camera pose), no stereo/multi-view geometry. cameraFixedInPlace is a plain bool flag and CameraCalibrationFlow.qml is an explicit STUB. CameraCapabilities has sensorWidthMm/sensorHeightMm fields but they are metadata, not a calibrated intrinsic matrix. True 3D triangulation from the 2 cameras (face-on + DTL) is impossible without adding a calibration step + solvePnP/triangulatePoints (OpenCV calib3d is available since OpenCV is linked, but no code uses it).
- NO 3D pose: PoseResult/PoseKeypoint are 2D normalized x/y only. There is no lifting model (2D->3D), no SMPL/SMPL-X body model, no monocular-3D ONNX model. The Y-bot BodyVizView is driven by BodyPoseAdapter doing 2D-keypoint->bone-quaternion heuristics, not metric 3D.
- Pose keypoints are NOT buffered: pose runs live per-frame and results are ephemeral (cleared during replay). The offline analyzer receives no pose in the SwingWindow — it must re-run ONNX inference on the buffered raw frames itself (which means instantiating a pose estimator on the worker thread, contending with the live pipeline and the exporter).
- NO temporal-alignment / sequence library: no DTW, no swing-phase segmentation (address/top/impact/follow-through), no per-frame event detection beyond the single impact marker (ShotMarker shot_marker_v1, 16 bytes). A reference-swing comparison or phase detector would need a new DTW dep (MIT options exist) or hand-rolled code.
- NO scoring/metrics infrastructure: ShotAnalysisResult.score is an int 0-100 and metrics is an opaque QVariantMap of label/value strings — there is no biomechanics metric registry, no per-session-type metric schema, no reference baseline storage. The 0-100 score has no defined rubric.
- NO optimization library: no Ceres/g2o for bundle adjustment, IMU-camera fusion, or kinematic-chain fitting. Only Eigen (linear algebra) is present. A full multi-sensor 3D fusion (camera 2D + IMU orientation -> metric 3D skeleton) would likely want one.
- NO IMU-camera temporal/spatial cross-calibration: camera and IMU sources share the EventBuffer monotonic clock (good for time alignment) but there is no spatial registration between the IMU anatomical frame and any camera frame, so fusing the two coordinate systems is unsolved.
- Vulkan is NOT available to ONNX models — only whisper.cpp uses it. A new analyzer ONNX model gets CUDA/CoreML/DirectML/CPU only; on a Vulkan-only Linux GPU box (AMD/Intel without CUDA) the analyzer model would fall back to CPU.

## Appendix C — Checkpoint review (2026-06-17)

> **Status:** As-built audit · **Date:** 2026-06-17 · **Grounded against:** `main` @ `c90dcdf`
>
> A point-in-time review of the analyzer against this design and the commits since it was written
> (`1d6ac77..main`). This appendix supersedes the *Implementation notes (as-built, M1)* section as
> the **current-state record**; that section is retained as the M1 milestone snapshot (corrected
> inline). Headline: the analyzer is real and unexpectedly deep — **for the Wrist session only** —
> and has been validated **exclusively against synthetic data**. No live golfer swing has been
> analyzed end-to-end.

### What shipped vs the plan

Production entry is unchanged: `makeShotAnalyzer()` (`src/Analysis/shot_analyzer.cpp`) dispatches by
session type, and **only type 1 (Wrist) is a real analyzer** — Swing (0), GRF (2), Coach (3) still
return the timestamp-hash stub. `WristAnalyzer::analyze` (`src/Analysis/wrist_analyzer.cpp`) runs
the chain below over the frozen window.

| Layer / milestone | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** plumbing — widened job/result, unified `swing.json` single-writer, reload | **Done** | |
| **L3 Fusion** `ImuVisionFuser` (`q_anat = A·q·M`, 200 Hz grid) | **Done** | IMU-only; no camera-fusion / Kabsch yaw term yet |
| **L6 Phase** `PhaseSegmenter` (v2/v3 inertial ladder, `SegmentationConfig`) | **Done (pass 1)** | v3 **pass-2 shaft refinement is NOT run** (G4 on hold) |
| **L6 Metrics** `MetricExtractor` (wrist FE/RUD, pronation, elbow) | **Done** | |
| **L1 Detection** `PoseRunner` (offline **ViTPose**, swing-span bounded) | **Done** | deferred out of the M1 ship; now in production, v3-G3 bounded |
| **`ShaftTracker`** (face-on club, classical CV) → `impactShaftLean` series | **Done (S0–S4)** | unscored/provisional sign; degrades to invalid track; S5 pending |
| **L7 Scoring** `SwingScorer` (banded weighted geometric mean) | **Done** | bands **provisional / untuned** |
| Wrist **assessment engine** (`WristAssessmentEngine` + `reference_bands` + findings) | **Done** | a *separate* checkpoint-RAG system for the Wrist Motion review UI — **not** called by `WristAnalyzer` |
| **SwingLab** offline harness (L1–L5) + ~27 synthetic CTest targets | **Done** | synthetic corpus only |

The analyzer has quietly absorbed work the original M-plan placed much later: the offline pose pass
and the entire `ShaftTracker` + segmentation v2/v3 lines, all reprioritized **ahead** of camera
metric calibration via the three addenda above.

### Not built

- **Camera metric calibration (M2).** `src/Gui/calibration/CameraCalibrationFlow.qml` is still a
  placeholder with a disabled Start button; there is no `camera_calibrator`; `AppSettings` has no
  `cameraIntrinsics`/`cameraExtrinsics`/`cameraCalibrated`/`subjectHeightM`; and `ShotAnalysisJob`
  carries **no `cameraCalib` field** (only `imuBindings`). Metric scale therefore never lands.
- **L2 `Triangulator`/DLT, MonoLift/MotionBERT, L4 `TrackSmoother` (body Kalman+RTS), L5
  `SkeletonSolver` (IK), L8 `FaultRanker`, DTW similarity — none of these files exist.**
  Consequently there is **no `SkeletonTimeline`**, and the design's "analyzed skeleton drives
  `BodyVizView` replay" goal is unrealized (replay remains live-keypoint/video; `BodyVizView` is
  IMU-driven via `BodyPoseAdapter`).
- **Swing / GRF / Coach analyzers** — stubs.
- **M4 / M5 / M6** — not started.

### The validation gap (the dominant fact)

Every test in `src/Analysis/tests` uses synthetic fixtures (`pipeline_test` is literally
"Pure (no SwingWindow)"); **no recorded `SwingWindow` is exercised anywhere**, and no live swing has
been analyzed end-to-end. Compounding it:

- Hardware **sign-lock is incomplete** — the ~10–15° FE↔RUD cross-talk from unobservable yaw, and
  the right-arm / left-handed sign, are unverified (`shot_analyzer_m1_wrist.md §11.B`).
- **Both** band tables are explicitly provisional: `SwingScorer`'s `kWristBands` and the assessment
  engine's `reference_bands` ("starting heuristics … every number is expected to move once tuned
  against real swings").
- The recorded **corpus is flagged unreliable** by the 2026-06-11 decision; **corpus-v1 has not
  been recorded**, so SwingLab's real missions cannot run. `ShaftTracker` S5 and segmentation v3 G4
  are both studio-gated on the same data.

### What's left, prioritized

**Tier 1 — close the loop on what exists (before adding breadth).**
1. Record **corpus-v1** (clean, with calibration provenance) → run SwingLab real missions → **tune
   the provisional bands** and **finish hardware sign-lock**. This is *the* gate: the stack is
   "theoretically complete, never seen a real golfer."
2. `ShaftTracker` **S5** hardware verification → unblock segmentation **v3 G4** (pass-2 shaft
   refinement of Delivery/Release/Top + the `MetricExtractor`-after-pass-2 reorder; both
   coded-and-waiting).
3. M1 `§11` tidy-ups: in-replay graph verify, export-fail header fallback, MP4-backed replay
   reload, the exact quaternion-referenced Δ curve.

**Tier 2 — breadth, reusing the existing spine.**
4. **Swing / Coach analyzers** — the cheapest large win: the fuse→segment→metric→score machinery is
   session-agnostic and the body orientation metrics (X-factor, kinematic sequence, rotations) are
   IMU-delivered and camera-count-independent. These sessions currently get a *hash*, not analysis.
   Coach = Swing + DTW; GRF = kinematic estimate, clearly labelled.
5. **IMU slot-map fix** (a clean pelvis+thorax pair vs thorax/lumbar/T12) — the real unlock for
   `xFactor`/`pelvisRotation`; an instrumentation change, not a camera one.

**Tier 3 — heavy, model/calibration-risky (defer until a metric demands it).**
6. M2 camera calibration (ChArUco + ground-plane `solvePnP`) → sway/lift/tilt in cm, shaft lean /
   clubhead speed in real units.
7. M3 second camera + DLT (club path / attack / thrust); M4 `TrackSmoother` + `SkeletonSolver` →
   `SkeletonTimeline`; M5 `FaultRanker` + reference-swing DTW + ranked feedback; M6 cross-platform
   GPU / latency.

### What to reconsider

1. **Make validation the explicit stop-the-line gate; freeze breadth until it closes.** The chief
   risk is a large synthetic-only-validated stack with provisional bands and unverified signs, while
   the data that would validate it does not exist. Every metric/analyzer added pre-corpus-v1
   compounds untested surface area.
2. **Resolve the two parallel wrist banding systems.** `SwingScorer` (post-shot summary card) and
   `WristAssessmentEngine`/`reference_bands` (checkpoint-RAG diagnostics UI) both grade lead-wrist
   FE/RUD + pronation with **independent provisional band tables** that can disagree (a green RAG
   matrix alongside a mediocre overall score). Converge on one band source of truth — the
   `IReferenceBandProvider` seam is the better-designed, archetype-aware one — or document precisely
   why the two legitimately need different thresholds. Tuning two sets against corpus-v1
   independently is wasted effort and a divergence trap.
3. **De-risk (or drop) the MotionBERT-lift / IK-skeleton branch (M4).** It is the heaviest, most
   model/license-fragile, hardest-to-validate part, and the value actually shipped needs none of it
   (`BodyVizView` is already IMU-driven). Confirm a concrete metric or replay feature that genuinely
   requires a reconstructed `SkeletonTimeline` before building it on spec.
4. **Watch the now-live latency cost.** ViTPose runs per-frame for every Wrist shot; the v3
   swing-span bounding (the right lever) is wired, but CPU-only the pose pass is ~10–30 s. Confirm
   the budget on the actual studio machine. Minor: the SwingLab hooks (`poseTrackPath`,
   `tuningOverrides`) have leaked into the production `ShotAnalysisJob` value type.
5. **Re-baseline the M-plan.** The M0–M6 numbering no longer maps to reality (the pose pass and the
   `ShaftTracker` line jumped ahead of M2 calibration). The inline corrections above and this
   appendix realign the narrative; consider replacing the linear plan with the two-axis
   (camera × IMU) capability matrix the design itself argues for.
