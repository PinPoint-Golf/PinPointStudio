# Windows Release Runbook

How to cut a Windows release that the in-app updater (WinSparkle) will trust and
offer to users. Design: [`../design/windows_update.md`](../design/windows_update.md).

**The one rule that matters:** the EdDSA signing key never leaves your machine.
GitHub only ever sees the **public** key (committed) and the per-installer
**signature** (inside `appcast-win.xml`). If the private key leaks, anyone can ship a
"trusted" update to every user; if you lose it, you can't ship verifiable updates at
all. Back it up offline.

---

## Do this ONCE (first time only)

You only generate and pin the key a single time, ever (until you deliberately rotate
it). After this, skip straight to the per-release checklist.

1. **Install the tools** (see [`../../BUILDING.md`](../../BUILDING.md)): the GitHub
   CLI (`gh auth login`) and Inno Setup 6 (ISCC). `winsparkle-tool.exe` is fetched by
   CMake — after any build it's under
   `build\**\_deps\winsparkle-src\bin\winsparkle-tool.exe`.

2. **Generate the signing key OFFLINE:**
   ```powershell
   $WS = (Get-ChildItem build -Recurse -Filter winsparkle-tool.exe | Select-Object -First 1).FullName
   & $WS generate-key --file C:\keys\pinpoint_win.key     # KEEP SECRET. BACK UP OFFLINE.
   & $WS public-key   --private-key-file C:\keys\pinpoint_win.key   # prints "Public key: <base64>"
   ```

3. **Pin the public key:** paste just the `<base64>` line (no "Public key:" prefix)
   into `src/Resources/keys/pinpoint_release_win_eddsa.pub`, replacing
   `PLACEHOLDER_UNTIL_P2_KEY_GENERATED`. Commit it.

   > Until a build carrying the real key is in users' hands, the updater is inert by
   > design (it refuses the placeholder). So the **first** release that includes the
   > pinned key is what "bootstraps" auto-update — users must install that one
   > normally; every release *after* it can auto-update. Plan key rollout one release
   > ahead of when you need updates to work.

## Do this FOR EACH RELEASE

### 1. Bump the version — `src/Core/version.h` only
Edit these and commit + push:
- `PINPOINT_VERSION_MAJOR` / `PINPOINT_VERSION_MINOR` / `PINPOINT_VERSION_POSTFIX`
  — the human version (e.g. `-alpha3`, or `""` for a clean release).
- **`PINPOINT_VERSION_BUILD`** — the monotonic integer the updater compares. **It must
  be strictly larger than the last release** or WinSparkle won't offer the update.
  Formula in the file: `MAJOR*1_000_000 + MINOR*10_000 + PATCH*100 + prerelease`.

That's the *only* version edit — CMake derives the installer version from it, and the
app's WinSparkle display/build version comes from it too. Nothing else to bump.

### 2. Build the `-core` installer (the update payload)
Either let CI do it, or build locally — pick one.

**Option A — CI builds it (recommended).** Push a tag; the `windows` job in
`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the unsigned `-core` installer and stages it on
a **draft** release:
```bash
TAG=v0.1-alpha3                              # free-form; any tag GitHub accepts
git tag "$TAG" && git push origin "$TAG"     # → triggers the build; wait for it to finish
```
Then download the *exact* bytes CI built (you must sign these, not a rebuild):
```powershell
$TAG = 'v0.1-alpha3'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force C:\tmp\rel | Out-Null
gh release download $TAG -R PinPoint-Golf/PinPointStudio -p '*-core.exe' -D C:\tmp\rel
$exe = (Get-ChildItem C:\tmp\rel\PinPointStudioSetup-*-core.exe).FullName
```

**Option B — build locally** (no CI, or you want to build on your own machine):
```powershell
pwsh -File packaging\build_installer.ps1 -Components core
$exe = (Get-ChildItem build\Release-Installer -Recurse -Filter 'PinPointStudioSetup-*-core.exe' |
        Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Desc | Select-Object -First 1).FullName
```

### 3. Sign it + generate the appcast
```powershell
pwsh -File packaging\make_appcast.ps1 -PrivateKeyFile C:\keys\pinpoint_win.key -Tag $TAG -Installer $exe
```
This signs `$exe` with your offline key and writes `appcast-win.xml` next to it (the
feed item: version, enclosure URL, signature, length). Optional: add
`-NotesUrl https://github.com/PinPoint-Golf/PinPointStudio/releases/download/$TAG/release-notes-win.html`
to show "what's new" in WinSparkle's window.

### 4. Verify the signature locally (exactly as the app will)
```powershell
$WS  = (Get-ChildItem build -Recurse -Filter winsparkle-tool.exe | Select-Object -First 1).FullName
$pub = (Get-Content src\Resources\keys\pinpoint_release_win_eddsa.pub -Raw).Trim()
$sig = ([regex]::Match((Get-Content (Join-Path (Split-Path $exe) appcast-win.xml) -Raw),
        'edSignature="([^"]+)"')).Groups[1].Value
& $WS verify --public-key $pub --signature $sig $exe     # must report a VALID signature
```
If this doesn't verify, **stop** — do not publish. (Most common cause: you signed a
rebuild instead of the exact CI bytes.)

### 5. Upload the assets + publish
```powershell
$appcast = Join-Path (Split-Path $exe) 'appcast-win.xml'
# Option A (CI): the -core .exe is already on the draft — just add the appcast:
gh release upload $TAG -R PinPoint-Golf/PinPointStudio $appcast
gh release edit   $TAG -R PinPoint-Golf/PinPointStudio --draft=false --prerelease=false

# Option B (local): create the release with BOTH assets:
gh release create $TAG -R PinPoint-Golf/PinPointStudio `
   --title "PinPoint Studio $TAG" --notes "…release notes…" $exe $appcast
```
**Publish non-draft AND non-prerelease** — `releases/latest/download/appcast-win.xml`
(the URL baked into the app) only resolves to a non-prerelease release.

> `gh release create` (Option B) creates the `v*` tag, which fires `release.yml`. Its
> **`guard` job detects the already-published release and skips the build jobs**, so
> CI won't re-draft your release or overwrite the signed installer — no need to cancel
> the run by hand.

### 6. Confirm it's live
```bash
gh release view "$TAG" -R PinPoint-Golf/PinPointStudio --json assets \
  --jq '.assets[].name'      # expect: PinPointStudioSetup-<ver>-core.exe AND appcast-win.xml
```
On a machine running an **older installed** build: Settings → General → **Check for
updates** (or wait for the launch check) → WinSparkle offers it, downloads the
installer, verifies the signature, and relaunches on the new version — no UAC prompt.

## Quick checklist (per release)

- [ ] Bump `PINPOINT_VERSION_BUILD` (+ MAJOR/MINOR/POSTFIX) in `version.h`, commit, push
- [ ] Build the `-core` installer (CI tag push, or `build_installer.ps1 -Components core`)
- [ ] If CI: `gh release download` the exact `-core.exe`
- [ ] `make_appcast.ps1` → signs + writes `appcast-win.xml`
- [ ] `winsparkle-tool verify` the signature — stop if it fails
- [ ] Upload `-core.exe` + `appcast-win.xml`; publish **non-draft, non-prerelease**
- [ ] Confirm assets + test an update from an older build

## Gotchas & notes
- **Sign the bytes you publish.** In Option A, sign the installer you *downloaded from
  the draft*, never a local rebuild — a rebuild differs byte-for-byte and the signature
  won't verify, so every client rejects the update.
- **`BUILD` must always increase.** It's the only thing WinSparkle compares. If you
  forget to bump it, installed apps see "no newer version".
- **Never publish without `appcast-win.xml`.** No appcast → no feed item. A missing or
  mismatched signature → the installer is rejected and never runs.
- **CUDA is separate (design §4.4).** The `-core` installer is the only thing in the
  appcast. The CUDA/GPU runtime is offered and updated by the app itself based on the
  hardware it detects — never put the `-cuda` installer in the appcast.
- **Mixed-platform releases are fine.** The same GitHub release can also carry the
  Linux `*.AppImage*` assets; WinSparkle only ever looks at `appcast-win.xml` and the
  Linux updater only looks at its own assets.
- **Rollback:** re-draft or delete the release
  (`gh release edit <tag> --draft=true` / `gh release delete <tag>`) and the updater
  stops offering it immediately.
- **Rotating the key:** generate a new key, pin the new public key, and ship a release
  with it — but remember only users who install that release can verify updates signed
  by the new key. Keep signing with the *old* key until that release has propagated.
