## 1. Philosophy — why tests are decoupled from the app

The app target is heavy: configuring it pulls in whisper.cpp/ggml, FFmpeg,
espeak-ng (built from source), OpenCV and ONNX Runtime — on the order of 20+
seconds just to *configure*, before a single object compiles. A unit test for,
say, pure shaft-kinematics math has no business waiting on any of that.

⚠ **The QML module is no longer part of that argument, and the difference matters.**
The Gui suite declares the `PinPointStudio` QML module itself, from the same lists
the app builds it from (`cmake/PinPointQmlModule.cmake`), so its offscreen UI tests
can press real components. It still depends on no app target — the module's C++
needs only Qt, and its link closure stays inside sources other suites already
compile. The invariant is *decoupled from the app*; *never builds QML* was only a
proxy for it, and holding the proxy is what kept the only UI coverage in the repo
out of every release gate on every platform.

So **the test suites are not part of the app build.** The root `CMakeLists.txt`
forces `BUILD_TESTING OFF`; building the app never compiles a test. Instead each
suite is a small, self-contained CMake project that **recompiles only the handful
of `.cpp` it needs** and stubs out anything that would drag in the heavy
dependencies (most notably `PpLogStream`, whose real implementation in
`pp_debug.cpp` pulls in whisper/ggml).

Two consequences worth internalising:

- There is **no `pinpoint_analysis` / `pinpoint_core` / `pinpoint_gui` library.**
  Tests list source files directly. The only real library target is
  `pinpoint_buffer` (`src/Buffer`), which the EventBuffer and IMU suites link.
- Tests must be **buildable offline-ish and fast.** Anything a test needs that
  the app would normally provide (a log sink, `EventBuffer::nowMicros`, …) is
  supplied by a local stub file in the suite.

This decoupling is the property to preserve. Do not "simplify" by folding the
suites into the app build under `BUILD_TESTING ON` — that reintroduces the heavy
configure on every test iteration.

---

## 2. The big picture

```
tests/
├── CMakeLists.txt            # the umbrella: builds all suites at once
├── CMakePresets.json         # tests / tests-asan / tests-tsan presets
├── cmake/
│   └── PinPointTests.cmake   # shared infra: Qt prefix, Eigen, sanitizers, pp_add_test
└── MIGRATION.md              # how the suites were consolidated (historical record)

src/<Sub>/tests/
└── CMakeLists.txt            # one suite; uses pp_add_test; works standalone too
```

Every suite runs **two ways**, from the same `src/<Sub>/tests/CMakeLists.txt`:

- **Standalone** — `cmake -S src/<Sub>/tests -B <build>` for fast single-suite
  iteration. A small bootstrap block at the top of each suite pulls in the shared
  module.
- **Under the umbrella** — `cmake -S tests -B build/tests` configures *all* suites
  in one shot; the bootstrap block is skipped (the shared module is already
  loaded) and the suite is `add_subdirectory`'d.

This is the same file in both cases — there is no duplication and no "umbrella
copy" of a suite to keep in sync.

---

## 3. How the umbrella orchestration works

`tests/CMakeLists.txt` is a thin driver:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(pinpoint_tests LANGUAGES CXX)

list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")
include(PinPointTests)        # Qt prefix, Eigen locate, sanitizers, gtest, pp_add_test
enable_testing()

# Buffer is special — see below.
add_subdirectory("${PP_SRC}/Buffer"       "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Buffer-lib")
add_subdirectory("${PP_SRC}/Buffer/tests" "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Buffer")

foreach(suite Analysis Audio Core Gui IMU LaunchMonitor Pose Update)
    add_subdirectory("${PP_SRC}/${suite}/tests" "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/${suite}")
endforeach()
```

Three details make this work:

1. **The shared module is included once, at the top.** It defines `pp_add_test`,
   `pp_find_eigen`, the sanitizer knob and the repo-layout variables (`PP_SRC`,
   `PP_BUFFER`, `PP_CORE`, `PP_THIRD`). Because it is loaded before any
   `add_subdirectory`, every suite sees `pp_add_test` already defined — which is
   exactly the signal each suite's bootstrap block uses to decide it is running
   under the umbrella (see §7).

2. **Buffer is special-cased.** Its tests live under `src/Buffer/tests` but are
   gated on `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL` *and* need the real `pinpoint_buffer` library
   target. So the umbrella adds the Buffer library first, then pulls in
   `src/Buffer/tests` directly. The IMU suite also needs `pinpoint_buffer`; it
   guards its own `add_subdirectory(Buffer)` with `if(NOT TARGET pinpoint_buffer)`
   so the umbrella and standalone paths don't collide ("binary dir already used").

3. **A default C++20 standard** is set by the shared module. Suites added as
   sibling directories don't inherit a parent suite's scope-local
   `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`, so the shared module pins the app's standard (C++20)
   globally. Individual targets override with `STD 17` / `STD 20` on
   `pp_add_test` where they care.

One configure produces one CTest registry spanning all suites:

```bash
cmake -S tests -B build/tests
cmake --build build/tests -j6
ctest --test-dir build/tests --output-on-failure   # every suite, incl. the offscreen qml_ui
```

---

## 4. The shared module — `tests/cmake/PinPointTests.cmake`

`include(PinPointTests)` sets up everything a suite needs. It is idempotent
(`include_guard(GLOBAL)`), so the umbrella and a standalone bootstrap can both
include it safely.

What it provides:

| Thing | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Repo layout** | `PP_REPO_ROOT`, `PP_SRC`, `PP_BUFFER`, `PP_CORE`, `PP_THIRD` |
| **Qt prefix** | The **newest** `~/Qt/<version>/<abi>` carrying a `Qt6Config.cmake` (`macos`, `gcc_64`, `msvc2022_64`), unless `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` / env already set. Compared by version, not sorted, so 6.10 beats 6.9. If none is found it says so rather than silently letting CMake find some other Qt. |
| **Qt + Threads** | `find_package(Qt6 Core Gui)` and `find_package(Threads)` once. Suites needing more (Qml, Bluetooth, OpenCV, Test for `QSignalSpy`) add their own — cheap and additive. |
| **C++ standard** | Default C++20 (app/Buffer parity); per-target `STD` overrides. |
| **`pp_find_eigen(<out>)`** | One Eigen locator: explicit `-DPP_EIGEN_DIR`, then any app build's `build/*/_deps/eigen-src` (matched regardless of build-dir name), then fetch 3.4.0. |
| **`pp_apply_sanitizers(<tgt>)`** | Applied automatically by `pp_add_test` from the `PP_SANITIZE` cache var. |
| **`pp_require_gtest()`** | Lazily fetches GoogleTest the first time a suite links it — gtest-free suites never pay for it. Called automatically by `pp_add_test` when `GTEST`/`GTEST_NO_MAIN` is requested. |
| **`pp_add_test(...)`** | The canonical test-target helper (see §5). |

### Eigen — the bug this fixed

Before consolidation, `src/Analysis/tests` globbed `build/*/_deps/eigen-src`
(correct) while `src/IMU/tests` **hardcoded the Linux build-dir name**
(`build/Desktop_Qt_6_11_0-Debug/...`). On macOS that path never matched, so
`eskf_gyro_units_test` was silently *skipped* — not failed, just absent. The
single `pp_find_eigen()` routine removed that whole class of per-suite path drift.
Always resolve Eigen through it.

### Sanitizers — one knob

All suites share `-DPP_SANITIZE`:

```bash
cmake -S tests -B build/tests-asan -DPP_SANITIZE="address;undefined"
cmake -S tests -B build/tests-tsan -DPP_SANITIZE=thread
```

Use a **separate build dir per sanitizer config** (the flags bake into objects).
`pp_add_test` applies them to every target automatically.

Two gotchas that have each cost an afternoon:

- **The Buffer suite does not use this knob.** It predates `pp_add_test` and keeps
  its own `-DPINPOINT_ENABLE_ASAN` / `_UBSAN` / `_TSAN` options (see
  `src/Buffer/CMakeLists.txt`). `-DPP_SANITIZE` configures the umbrella without
  touching Buffer's targets — which reads as "TSan found nothing" when TSan never
  ran.
- **Never set `detect_leaks=1` on arm64 macOS.** LeakSanitizer is unsupported
  there, and every test aborts at exit — a whole suite reporting as failing, with
  nothing wrong. ASan itself is fine; it is only the leak detector.

---

## 5. `pp_add_test` reference

```cmake
pp_add_test(<name>
    SOURCES <files...>            # required — test .cpp + the production .cpp it needs
    [LINK <libs...>]              # extra link libs (Qt6::Qml, ${OpenCV_LIBS}, pinpoint_buffer, …)
    [INCLUDE <dirs...>]           # extra include dirs (PP_BUFFER is always added)
    [DEFINES <defs...>]           # extra compile definitions
    [COMPILE_OPTIONS <opts...>]   # e.g. -O2 for timing-sensitive tests
    [STD 17|20]                   # CXX_STANDARD for this target (default: C++20)
    [AUTOMOC]                     # the test or its sources contain Q_OBJECT / QML_ELEMENT
    [GTEST]                       # link GTest::gtest_main (gtest supplies main())
    [GTEST_NO_MAIN]               # link GTest::gtest (the test supplies its own main())
    [NO_QT])                      # do NOT auto-link Qt6::Core/Gui (e.g. OpenCV-only math)
```

Behaviour:

- By default the target links **Qt6::Core + Qt6::Gui** and adds **`PP_BUFFER`**
  to the include path (`types.h` is near-ubiquitous). Pass `NO_QT` for a pure
  OpenCV or header-only math test.
- `GTEST` / `GTEST_NO_MAIN` trigger the lazy GoogleTest fetch. Use
  `GTEST_NO_MAIN` when the test needs its own `main()` — e.g. to spin a
  `QCoreApplication` for a `Q_OBJECT` + `QTimer` class.
- Every target is registered with CTest (`add_test`) and gets sanitizer flags
  from `PP_SANITIZE`.

Examples (real, from the suites):

```cmake
# Pure header-only math.
pp_add_test(wrist_angles_test SOURCES wrist_angles_test.cpp)

# OpenCV-only, no Qt, optimised hot loop.
pp_add_test(shaft_tracker_test
    SOURCES shaft_tracker_test.cpp ${ANALYSIS}/shaft_tracker_math.cpp
    INCLUDE ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}  LINK ${OpenCV_LIBS}
    COMPILE_OPTIONS -O2  NO_QT)

# GoogleTest + profiler core + a log stub (no whisper).
pp_add_test(pp_profiler_test
    SOURCES pp_profiler_test.cpp ${PROFILER_CORE}
    INCLUDE ${CORE}  LINK Threads::Threads
    DEFINES PINPOINT_PROFILE_BASELINE=1 PINPOINT_PROFILE=1  GTEST)

# Q_OBJECT controller with its own main().
pp_add_test(profiler_controller_test
    SOURCES profiler_controller_test.cpp ${MONITOR}/profiler_controller.cpp ${PROFILER_CORE}
    INCLUDE ${CORE} ${MONITOR}  LINK Threads::Threads
    GTEST_NO_MAIN  AUTOMOC)
```

Platform-specific bits that don't fit the keyword form (Apple `.mm` Metal
backends, `dxgi` on Windows) are applied **after** the `pp_add_test` call with
plain `target_sources` / `target_link_libraries` — see the GPU-metrics targets in
`src/Core/tests/CMakeLists.txt`.

---

## 6. Running the tests

### Everything at once (umbrella)

```bash
cmake -S tests -B build/tests
cmake --build build/tests -j6
ctest --test-dir build/tests --output-on-failure
```

### A single suite (standalone — fastest iteration)

```bash
cmake -S src/IMU/tests -B build/imu-tests
cmake --build build/imu-tests -j6
ctest --test-dir build/imu-tests --output-on-failure
```

(The Qt prefix is auto-resolved; pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.x/<abi>`
only if Qt is installed somewhere non-standard.)

### Via presets

`tests/CMakePresets.json` defines `tests`, `tests-asan`, `tests-tsan`. CMake
reads `CMakePresets.json` from the current directory, so run them **from
`tests/`**:

```bash
cd tests
cmake --preset tests
cmake --build --preset tests
ctest --preset tests
```

### Useful CTest filters

```bash
ctest --test-dir build/tests -R shaft        # only tests whose name matches /shaft/
ctest --test-dir build/tests -j6             # run tests in parallel
ctest --test-dir build/tests --rerun-failed --output-on-failure
```

---

## 7. Adding a test to an existing suite

1. Drop `my_thing_test.cpp` into `src/<Sub>/tests/`.
2. Add one `pp_add_test` call to that suite's `CMakeLists.txt`, listing the test
   plus any production `.cpp` it must compile (remember: there is no library to
   link — name the sources). Reach for the right flags from §5.
3. If the production code touches `PpLogStream`, add `src/Core/pp_log_stream.cpp`
   and `src/Core/PpMessageLog.cpp` to `SOURCES` — that is the real application
   log and it costs Qt and nothing else. **Do not** pull in `pp_debug.cpp`: that
   one still drags in whisper/ggml, because it also installs the message handler
   and silences whisper, ggml, OpenCV and FFmpeg.
4. Build + run standalone, then once under the umbrella.

For reference, every suite's `CMakeLists.txt` begins with this bootstrap so it
works standalone *and* under the umbrella — you won't normally touch it:

```cmake
# Standalone bootstrap: pull in the shared module when configured on our own.
# Under the umbrella pp_add_test already exists, so this block is skipped.
if(NOT COMMAND pp_add_test)
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
    project(pinpoint_<sub>_tests LANGUAGES CXX)
    list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../../tests/cmake)
    include(PinPointTests)
    enable_testing()
endif()
```

---

## 8. Adding a brand-new suite

Put tests **next to the code they exercise**, in a `tests/` subfolder of that
subsystem — `src/<NewSub>/tests/`. This keeps the relative `../foo.cpp` includes
short and the co-located stubs/fixtures obvious. (Don't create a single global
`tests/` dump of all test sources — only the *orchestration* is centralised, not
the test files.)

**A `tests/` folder does not have to mean a new suite.** `src/Diagnostics/tests/`,
`src/Export/tests/` and `src/Metrics/tests/` hold sources with no `CMakeLists.txt`
of their own — the Analysis suite compiles them by absolute path
(`SOURCES ${SRC}/Export/tests/swing_doc_test.cpp …`), because each links
`swing_analysis.h` or the pack value types and a separate project would duplicate
that whole dependency set for a handful of targets. Prefer this when the new tests
would pull in the same dependencies as an existing suite; add a real suite only
when the dependency set genuinely differs.

1. Create `src/<NewSub>/tests/CMakeLists.txt` starting with the bootstrap block
   from §7 (substitute the project name).
2. Add your `pp_add_test` calls.
3. Register the suite in the umbrella — add its name to the `foreach` list in
   `tests/CMakeLists.txt` (or, if it needs a library like Buffer, add a
   dedicated `add_subdirectory` with the same special-casing).
4. Verify standalone, then under the umbrella.
5. Add a one-line entry to the suite catalog in `BUILDING.md`.

If the new suite needs Eigen, call `pp_find_eigen(<var>)`. If it needs a
dependency the shared module doesn't `find_package` (OpenCV, Qt6::Bluetooth,
Qt6::Qml), `find_package` it in the suite — that is additive and cached.

⚠ **The QML UI suite is the one target that does not follow step 2**, and it is worth
knowing why before copying it. `pp_add_test` cannot express it — that helper uses plain
`add_executable` and hardcodes `Qt6::Core`/`Qt6::Gui`, with no hook for a test
`ENVIRONMENT` — so `qml_ui_test` is spelled out by hand. It also lives in
`src/Gui/CMakeLists.txt` rather than `src/Gui/tests/`, pulled in by `add_subdirectory`:
`qt_add_qml_module` names each file's qmlcachegen output directory after the path
*relative to `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`*, so declaring it from `tests/` yields
`qml_ui_test_../theme` — which POSIX resolves and ninja on Windows rejects outright.
`src/Gui` is an ancestor of all 157 QML files, so the paths come out clean. Anything else
declaring a QML module from a test directory will hit the same wall.

---

## 9. Conventions and gotchas

- **Test framework is per-suite, not enforced.** Buffer, Core, Update and
  LaunchMonitor use GoogleTest; Analysis, Audio, Gui, IMU and Pose use a hand-rolled
  `main()` + `CHECK`/`CHECK_NEAR` macros. Both are fine — match the suite you're
  editing.
- **`AUTOMOC` is per-target now.** The old suites set a global `CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON`;
  with `pp_add_test` you pass `AUTOMOC` on the targets that have `Q_OBJECT` /
  `QML_ELEMENT`. Forgetting it shows up as undefined-symbol link errors for the
  class's signals/vtable.
- **A `Q_OBJECT` header with no paired `.cpp` must be listed in `SOURCES`.** AUTOMOC
  moc's a header automatically when it shares a basename with a compiled `.cpp`
  (e.g. `foo.h` ↔ `foo.cpp`). A pure-interface or test-double header that has *no*
  matching `.cpp` (e.g. an abstract base, or a `FakeXxx` test double) is **not**
  picked up just by being `#include`d — list the `.h` itself in `SOURCES` so AUTOMOC
  generates its `moc_*.cpp`. Symptom otherwise: `undefined reference to vtable` /
  `staticMetaObject` for that class. (The Update suite lists `update_backend.h` and
  `fake_update_backend.h` for exactly this reason.)
- **`QSignalSpy` lives in `Qt6::Test`, not Core/Gui.** A suite that spies on signal
  emissions/ordering must `find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Test)` and `LINK Qt6::Test`.
- **Compiling a real settings-backed class? Isolate QSettings.** The Update policy
  test compiles the real `AppSettings`/`SessionController` (they expose exactly the
  API the controller touches) rather than maintaining doubles. Because `AppSettings`
  uses a fixed `QSettings` org/app, the test's `main()` calls
  `QStandardPaths::setTestModeEnabled(true)` **before** `QCoreApplication` so it
  never reads or writes the developer's real settings file.
- **Never link `pp_debug.cpp`** — it pulls in whisper/ggml for `PinPointDebug::install()`,
  which silences whisper, ggml, OpenCV and FFmpeg at startup. **Link
  `src/Core/pp_log_stream.cpp` + `src/Core/PpMessageLog.cpp` instead**: that is
  `ppWarn()`/`ppInfo()` itself, and it needs Qt and nothing more.

  Until 31 Aug 2026 the log primitive lived in `pp_debug.cpp`, so every suite
  linked a stub that satisfied the linker and **threw every log line away** —
  `Core/tests/pp_log_stub.cpp` (six suites), plus copies in
  `Analysis/tests/imu_test_stubs.cpp` and `Pose/tests/pose_test_stubs.cpp`. All of
  them now carry the real log, so a test can assert on a line instead of
  discarding it. `Core/tests/pp_log_stub.cpp` is kept for anything that
  deliberately wants silence; nothing in the tree needs it.
  (`Gui/tests/reanalysis_stubs.cpp` is a different thing: it stubs the re-analysis
  worker body, not logging.)
- **C++20 unless you say otherwise.** Anything pulling in `event_buffer.h` →
  `swing_window.h` (`std::span`) needs C++20 — that's the default, so it just
  works; only set `STD 17` to deliberately pin an older standard.
- **Sanitizers need their own build dir.** Don't reconfigure an existing dir with
  `PP_SANITIZE` — make `build/tests-asan` / `build/tests-tsan`.
- **Windows/MSVC:** the OpenCV-using suites (Analysis, Pose) need
  `-DOpenCV_DIR=...` at configure (the app's auto-probe isn't in the test
  projects), and CTest needs Qt's `bin` + OpenCV's `bin` on `PATH` or the test
  exes fail with `0xc0000135` (DLL not found).
- **`build/` is gitignored.** Build dirs are disposable; never commit them.
- **Never name a lambda `emit`.** It is a Qt keyword macro. The symptom is not "redefinition" but a
  wall of `left operand of comma operator has no effect` on every call site, because the macro
  expands to nothing and `push(a, b, c)` becomes a comma expression.
- **A `find()` helper returns a pointer INTO a vector — bind the vector.**
  `find(buildXSeries(...), "key")` dangles the moment the full expression ends, and the crash is a
  null deref somewhere later that looks nothing like the cause. `club_delivery_test` was written
  that way first and segfaulted; every call there now goes through a named `const auto`.
- **Make a synthetic swing look like a swing, in TIME as well as geometry.** Producers resolve their
  address reference over a ±250 ms window about the Address event. A fixture compressed into 160 ms
  puts the TOP inside that window and contaminates the very reference the metric is measured
  against — which reads as a producer bug and is not one. `body_rotation_test` builds ~1.6 s at 240
  fps for exactly this reason.
- **A decision that reads live app state cannot be tested — extract the decision.**
  Not the same as "add a fake": if a policy reads five things off four controllers, the
  testable part is the JUDGEMENT, and the untestable part is the GATHERING, which is also
  the part that is hard to get wrong. `decideStandalone()` (`src/LaunchMonitor`) takes
  seven booleans and returns a verdict; the controller only fills the struct. The same
  split is why `linux_update_logic.cpp` exists. The tell that you need it: the policy has
  already behaved differently on a real machine than it did on paper — the launch
  monitor's did that twice, once because a precondition was missing entirely and once
  because the whole path sat behind a setting that was off, and neither was a coding
  error that any amount of care in the controller would have caught.
- **Enumerate the state space when it is small enough to enumerate.** Seven booleans is
  128 states; `standalone_gate_test` walks all of them and asserts exactly one records.
  Sampling the interesting-looking ones would not have caught a precondition added later
  without a thought about ordering. Where the combination count is small, exhaustive is
  cheaper to write than choosing representatives and arguing about the choice.
- **Return a verdict, not a bool, when several things can be false at once.** Which reason
  gets reported is a decision somebody should be able to read and revisit, and it belongs
  in a test rather than in the order the `if`s happened to be written. `standalone_gate`
  orders configuration before current state so a user still setting up hears about the
  setting rather than about capture — and there is a test asserting exactly that
  precedence, plus one asserting every refusal carries a reason.
- **Pin the REAL captured bytes, not a tidied version of them.** `gcquad_csv_parser_test`
  embeds the actual FSX2020 row verbatim — trailing comma, CRLF and all — because the
  format's quirks are the thing most likely to break, and a fixture retyped into what the
  format "obviously" is tests the author's belief rather than the device. The same reason
  `fake_shot.py` copies the exemplar's header byte for byte instead of composing one.
- **Assert SIGNS on synthetic tracks, accuracy on a corpus.** A sign is the one thing a synthetic
  fixture can pin exactly, and it is also the thing that silently grades every swing backwards when
  it is wrong. `upper_body_metrics_test` runs its whole sign suite twice — once normally, once
  through a MIRRORED camera with a left-handed golfer — because a convention that only holds for a
  right-hander filmed from one side is not a convention.

### The session-setup UI suite — `session_setup_ui`

`session_setup_ui_test` (declared beside `qml_ui_test` in `src/Gui/CMakeLists.txt`; tests, fakes and drivers in `src/Gui/tests/setup/`) loads the real session-setup and calibration QML over fake cameras, sensors and a fake HackMotion device. `session_setup_lint_test` reads the same sources statically. Design and results: `docs/design/session_wizard_refactor_design.md` §7 and §11.

- **Run:** `ctest --test-dir build/tests -R '^session_setup'` (about nine minutes). One file by hand:
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen QT_QUICK_BACKEND=rhi QSG_USE_SIMPLE_ANIMATION_DRIVER=1 build/tests/Gui/qmlui/session_setup_ui_test -input src/Gui/tests/setup/<file>.qml` (`windows` instead of `offscreen` on Windows). Test QML is read from the source tree at run time; production QML is compiled in.
- **It cannot make a sound.** The real `TingPlayer` is filtered out of the target and `tests/setup/silent_ting_player.h` takes its QML name. Keep it that way: the suite completes dozens of calibrations.
- **Offscreen draws nothing.** Behaviour cases run headless; the render cases in `tst_setup_guide_render.qml` skip there and need `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=cocoa` (or `windows`) on a visible desktop. `SETUP_GUIDE_GRABS=<dir>` saves the frames.
- **Every case fails on an unexpected QML warning** (`testLog`). A binding that breaks at run time has no build error; this is what catches it.
- **Never construct `AppSettings` in a test before `QSettings::setPath(IniFormat, UserScope, <scratch>)`.** `QStandardPaths::setTestModeEnabled` does not move the app's ini, and the constructor now writes (the one-time `imu/placement` → `imu/roles` migration).
- **On Windows it runs in a real window** (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=windows`, set by the ctest environment; by hand use `windows` in the line above). Offscreen + RHI has no working Quick 3D on Windows (2026-10-08): D3D11 cannot create a swapchain for an offscreen window ("Access is denied", then a warning every frame) and OpenGL aborts. The suite's window shows on screen while it runs — keep it unoccluded, or its render loop and Timers starve.
- **Every test window holds a `View3DKeepAlive`** (in `support/CalibDriver.qml`, `support/SetupDriver.qml` and the files that use neither). Qt 6.11.0's DEBUG Quick 3D crashes the render thread when a window's LAST View3D is destroyed — every time, on a plain View3D unloaded from a Loader; Qt's release libraries survive it. That was the suite's crash in the HackMotion calibration file (`QSSGRenderCamera::markDirty` + `0xfeeefeee`). The app holds one in each top-level window for the same reason; `src/Gui/viz/View3DKeepAlive.qml` has the bisection, `src/Gui/tests/probes/view3d_unload.qml` checks the app.
- **The test target embeds the shaders the app's QML loads** (view gain, topo background, Bayer demosaic) at the app's resource paths. A missing one is an "Empty shader passed to graphics pipeline" warning on a real D3D11 window — and a failed case.

## 10. File map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `tests/CMakeLists.txt` | Umbrella — builds all suites in one configure |
| `tests/cmake/PinPointTests.cmake` | Shared infra: Qt prefix, `pp_find_eigen`, sanitizers, lazy gtest, `pp_add_test` |
| `tests/CMakePresets.json` | `tests` / `tests-asan` / `tests-tsan` presets (run from `tests/`) |
| `tests/MIGRATION.md` | Historical record of the consolidation + remaining cleanup |
| `src/Analysis/tests/` | **84** — by far the largest. Wrist-assessment engine, the stage mechanism and one test per stage, segmentation/metrics, shaft + clubhead + ball tracking, pose helpers, scoring and norms, the diagnostics/characteristic packs, orientation filters, IMU driver parse, the shot arbiter, and the Export round-trip. Reach for `ctest -R <pattern>` here, not the whole suite. |
| `src/Buffer/tests/` | Lock-free ring, timeline merge, watchdog, thread-policy, fuzz (8, GoogleTest, links `pinpoint_buffer`). **Not migrated to `pp_add_test`** — own gtest fetch, own `PINPOINT_ENABLE_*` sanitizer options. |
| `src/Core/tests/` | Resource profiler (core, concurrency/TSan, compile-out), OS + GPU metrics, stats log, profiler controller (7, GoogleTest) |
| `src/Gui/tests/` | TimelineLabels, chart metrics, SwingSeriesModel, ShotListModel, ReanalysisController, QML reactivity (6) |
| `src/IMU/tests/` | Impact detector, ImuIoWorker, ESKF gyro-unit pin (3) |
| `src/LaunchMonitor/tests/` | `LastShot.CSV` parsing (columns by name not position, metric **and** imperial units as FSX2020 declares them, closure rate in dps **or** rpm, the derived values, malformed/torn/short input), shot attribution, and the standalone gate exhaustive over all 2^7 precondition states (3, GoogleTest; the pairing test writes its own fixtures into a `QTemporaryDir` and needs Qt6 Test) |
| `src/Pose/tests/` | v2 temporal ball tracker + its live/offline parity, BallDetector throttle contract, heatmap decode, pose-model selection (5) |
| `src/Audio/tests/` | Acoustic onset detector (1) |
| `src/Diagnostics/tests/`, `src/Export/tests/`, `src/Metrics/tests/` | **Sources only — no suite of their own.** Compiled by the Analysis suite (counted in its 84) because they link `swing_analysis.h` / the pack types. See below. |
| `src/Update/tests/` | Linux updater pure logic (version compare, arch-aware AppImage asset selection, GPG VALIDSIG parse, placeholder-key refusal), `PlatformTarget` arch tokens, and `UpdateController` state-machine + relaunch session-safety policy via a `FakeUpdateBackend` (3, GoogleTest; policy test needs Qt6 Qml + Test) |
