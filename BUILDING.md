# Building PinPoint Studio

This document outlines the dependencies and steps required to build PinPoint Studio from source on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## General Requirements

- **CMake**: 3.16 or higher (3.24+ recommended — `DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP` support).
- **Qt 6.11**: Quick, QuickControls2, Quick3D, SerialPort, Bluetooth, Multimedia, Network, WebSockets, Concurrent, ShaderTools, GuiPrivate, CorePrivate (the Private modules back the RHI Bayer-demosaic video item).
- **C++ Compiler**: C++20 capable (`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20`, required) — GCC 10+, Clang 12+, or MSVC 2022.
- **OpenCV**: 3.0+ (required on all platforms — pose preprocessing, swing export demosaic).
- **OpenSSL** 1.1.1+ and **libppcp** (optional, but both or neither): the PPCP capture-device link — TLS 1.3 with an external pre-shared key — that lets a phone running PinPoint Capture join a session as a camera. Missing either one, the build warns and produces an app with no phone support; it never falls back to an unencrypted link. Two further pieces are per-platform *capabilities* on top: a DNS-SD provider for reconnection discovery, and a usbmux provider for the wired (USB) link. Per-platform instructions below.
- **FFmpeg** (optional): libavcodec/libavformat/libavutil/libswscale dev libraries with **libx264**, located via `pkg-config`. Powers the swing-export H.264/MP4 encoder. Without it the app still builds and runs, but swing video export is disabled. GPL FFmpeg builds are fine — the project is GPLv2+.

---

## Linux

PinPoint Studio uses `pkg-config` to locate system libraries.

### 1. Install Build Essentials
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config git
```
`git` is required at configure time — CMake clones whisper.cpp, libsamplerate, Eigen, and (if absent on the system) espeak-ng via FetchContent.

### 2. Install Qt 6.11
Use the [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). Select the following modules:
- Qt Quick / Qt Quick Controls 2 / Qt Quick 3D
- Qt Serial Port, Qt Bluetooth, Qt Multimedia
- Qt Network, Qt WebSockets, Qt Concurrent, Qt Shader Tools

### 3. System Dependencies
```bash
# Industrial camera support (Aravis v0.8.x)
sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libaravis-dev

# Camera device identifier lookup (USB serial numbers for V4L2 cameras)
sudo apt install libudev-dev

# Pose estimation and video pre-processing
sudo apt install libopencv-dev

# Swing video export (H.264 via libx264) — optional but recommended
sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev

# Optional: espeak-ng (built from source if absent)
sudo apt install libespeak-ng-dev

# PPCP capture-device link (TLS pre-shared key) — needed for src/Ppcp
sudo apt install libssl-dev

# PPCP reconnection discovery (DNS-SD via Avahi's Bonjour compatibility layer)
sudo apt install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

# PPCP wired (USB) capture — runtime only, no headers needed
sudo apt install usbmuxd
```

Without `libssl-dev` the build still configures and succeeds; it warns, and the
resulting app has no PPCP transport, so it cannot link to a capture device. It
never falls back to an unencrypted link — `PPCP-RV` 5.2f forbids that under any
circumstance and there is no code path in `src/Ppcp` that could.

`libssl-dev` is only half of the PPCP requirement: the transport also needs
**libppcp**, which is a sibling checkout rather than a package — see
[Co-developing libppcp](#co-developing-libppcp) below. With one of the two
missing the build prints a warning naming which, and the app has no phone
support.

The other two lines are **capabilities, not prerequisites** — a box without them
builds and runs identically, minus one feature each, and CMake says so with a
`STATUS` line rather than a warning:

- **`libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev`** buys reconnection discovery, so a remembered
  phone finds this computer again without a fresh pairing code. It exposes the
  same `dns_sd.h` API as Apple's own, so there is one code path on all three
  platforms. Without it, pairing by code still works (`PPCP-RV` 3.6b).
- **`usbmuxd`** is the daemon that carries the wired link (`/var/run/usbmuxd`);
  it is a *runtime* dependency of the finished app, not a build one — the usbmux
  client in `src/Ppcp/ppcp_usbmux.cpp` is first-party and needs no library. The
  socket's permissions may need a group membership on some distributions.

### 4. GPU Acceleration (Optional)

#### Whisper (STT)
- **Vulkan** (recommended — works on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libvulkan-dev glslc
  ```
  `glslc` is the shader compiler ggml's Vulkan backend invokes at build time (CMake's `Vulkan_GLSLC_EXECUTABLE`).
- **CUDA**: Install the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Vulkan is preferred and checked first; CUDA is the fallback when Vulkan headers are absent.

#### ONNX Runtime (TTS / pose estimation)
`WITH_CUDA` defaults ON. **Unlike the Windows path, the Linux CMake does not probe the installed CUDA version.** When `WITH_CUDA=ON` it unconditionally downloads `onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu-1.26.0.tgz`, which is built against **CUDA 12.x + cuDNN 9**. There is no CUDA-13 Linux package selection (the `gpu_cuda13` variant exists only for Windows).

- **CUDA 12.x runtime + cuDNN 9 installed** → the CUDA EP loads and ORT runs on the GPU.
- **CUDA 13.x installed (no CUDA 12 alongside)** → the CUDA-12-built EP fails to load at runtime because it imports CUDA-12-versioned shared libraries (e.g. `libcublasLt.so.12`, `libcudnn.so.9`), so ORT **silently falls back to CPU**. To get GPU ORT under CUDA 13, install a CUDA 12.x runtime alongside it (the EP only needs the CUDA 12 `.so`s present, not as the default toolkit), or wait for a CUDA-13 Linux package to be wired into CMake.
- **No CUDA, incompatible CUDA, or `-DWITH_CUDA=OFF`** → ORT runs on CPU. Passing `-DWITH_CUDA=OFF` also avoids the larger GPU download, fetching the CPU-only `onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.26.0.tgz` instead.

> cuDNN 9 is a separate install from the CUDA Toolkit. On Linux install the cuDNN 9 runtime matching CUDA 12 from NVIDIA's apt repository (e.g. `libcudnn9-cuda-12`) or the [cuDNN download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).

> **Intel integrated GPU (including Linux on MacBook Pro Intel):**
> ORT's only GPU execution provider on Linux is CUDA. Intel UHD and Iris integrated graphics cannot use it.
> OpenVINO would be the natural alternative EP for Intel hardware, but it requires building ORT from source
> (`-DONNXRUNTIME_USE_OPENVINO=ON`) — Intel stopped bundling their own ORT build in the OpenVINO toolkit
> after the 2024.x series. Pre-built `libonnxruntime_providers_openvino.so` is not available for download.
> ORT therefore runs on CPU on any Linux machine without an NVIDIA GPU.

---

## macOS

Dependencies are best managed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
brew install cmake espeak-ng aravis opencv ffmpeg openssl@3
```
`openssl@3` is the PPCP capture-device link (`src/Ppcp`, TLS with a pre-shared
key). It is keg-only, so CMake probes `brew --prefix openssl@3` directly rather
than relying on the default search — otherwise it would find LibreSSL, which has
no external-PSK session callbacks at all. Omit it and the build succeeds with a
warning and no PPCP transport; it never falls back to an unencrypted link.
CMake injects the Homebrew prefix into `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` automatically, so `ffmpeg` is found without any extra configuration.

The rest of PPCP needs nothing installed on macOS. DNS-SD (reconnection
discovery) comes free from libSystem, and the wired link talks to Apple's own
`usbmuxd` at `/var/run/usbmuxd`, which is always present. The transport does
still need **libppcp** beside this repository — see
[Co-developing libppcp](#co-developing-libppcp).

> ⚠ **A cabled phone that keeps dropping is an OS setting, not a bug.** macOS's
> "iPhone USB" tethering service can flap and force a USB re-configuration that
> tears down every usbmux tunnel. The symptom, the diagnosis and the one-line
> fix are in the README's
> [Phone capture troubleshooting](README.md#troubleshooting--a-wired-link-that-keeps-dropping-macos).

### 2. Install Qt 6.11
Use the [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) or:
```bash
brew install qt@6
export PATH="$(brew --prefix qt@6)/bin:$PATH"
```

### 3. GPU Acceleration

| Platform | Whisper (STT) | ONNX Runtime (TTS / pose) |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) | Metal (via ggml) | CoreML (ORT 1.26.0) |
| Intel Mac | CPU only | CPU only (ORT pinned to 1.20.1 — last Intel release) |

No additional GPU SDK installation is needed on Apple Silicon — CoreML and Metal are part of the OS.

### 4. Dev Code Signing (recommended)

```bash
tools/setup_dev_signing.sh
```

Run once per machine. Without it the dev bundle is left **unsigned** and the build prints a warning; everything still compiles and runs, but **camera / microphone / speech / Bluetooth permissions have to be granted again after every rebuild**. macOS keys those grants (TCC) to the binary's code signature, and an unsigned build has no durable identity to match — the app shows as "enabled" in System Settings while every entitled API returns Denied.

The script creates a self-signed `PinPoint Dev` identity in a **dedicated keychain** (`~/Library/Keychains/pinpoint-dev.keychain-db`, password in `~/.config/pinpoint/dev-keychain.pass`, mode 0600) and `cmake/DevCodesign.cmake` signs the finished bundle with it at POST_BUILD.

The dedicated keychain is the point, not an implementation detail. The login keychain unlocks only by **prompting**, so any build not driven from a desktop session — an agent or CI job over SSH, which launchd reports as session `Background` rather than `Aqua` — cannot use it, and codesign fails `errSecInternalComponent` with no way to ask. A keychain whose password is on disk unlocks with no interaction, which is the same reason fastlane ships `create_keychain`/`setup_ci`.

> **Moving an identity that already has grants.** TCC matches the *designated requirement*, which pins the certificate (`certificate leaf = H"…"`), so a new cert silently resets every permission. To keep them, export the old identity and adopt it: `tools/setup_dev_signing.sh --p12 <file>`. The export itself must run from **Terminal.app on the machine** — exporting a private key always requires GUI approval and no ACL or partition list covers it:
> ```bash
> security export -t identities -f pkcs12 -P <pass> -o /tmp/pp.p12
> ```

Troubleshooting: `codesign` resolves `-s <name>` through the keychain **search list, in order** (its `--keychain` flag does *not* affect identity lookup — it reports `no identity found`), so `pinpoint-dev.keychain-db` must come first in `security list-keychains -d user`. A stale copy of the same identity in an earlier keychain shadows it and fails. This is entirely separate from the release path in `tools/package_macos.sh`, which signs with a Developer ID cert from the login keychain in a real desktop session.

---

## Windows

### 1. Visual Studio
Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.

### 2. Qt 6.11
Install via the [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). Select the **MSVC 2022 64-bit** component.

### 3. GPU Acceleration

#### Whisper (STT) — ggml backends
Vulkan is detected and preferred over CUDA. Install whichever you have:
- **Vulkan SDK**: [vulkan.lunarg.com](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) — works on NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel Arc.
- **CUDA Toolkit**: [developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) — CUDA fallback when Vulkan headers are absent. Any recent CUDA version works.

#### ONNX Runtime (TTS / pose estimation) — CUDA EP
ORT 1.26.0 ships two Windows GPU packages. CMake selects automatically based on the installed CUDA Toolkit major version:

| Installed CUDA | ORT package selected | EP in app |
|---|---|---|
| CUDA 12.x | `onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu-1.26.0.zip` | CUDA |
| CUDA 13.x | `onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu_cuda13-1.26.0.zip` | CUDA |
| Other / none | `onnxruntime-win-x64-1.26.0.zip` | CPU |

> **Note:** DirectML was discontinued from ORT packages after version 1.24.4 and is no longer supported.

#### cuDNN 9 (required for ORT CUDA EP)
The ORT CUDA EP depends on **cuDNN 9** at runtime. Install it from the [NVIDIA cuDNN download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (free developer account required). Use the **Windows installer** — it places the DLLs under `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v9.x\bin\<cuda_major>.<minor>\x64\`.

CMake automatically copies the matching cuDNN DLLs next to the executable at POST_BUILD, so no PATH changes are needed after installation.

> **cuDNN must be installed before running CMake configure** — the glob that finds the DLLs runs at configure time.

### 4. Spinnaker SDK (Optional)
For Teledyne/FLIR industrial cameras, install the [Spinnaker SDK](https://www.teledyneflir.com/products/spinnaker-sdk/) to the default location: `C:\Program Files\Teledyne\Spinnaker`.

The build machine needs the SDK to compile the backend (headers + import lib), and
`HAVE_SPINNAKER` is defined automatically when CMake finds it. The SDK is **never
redistributed**: its imports are delay-loaded and the DLLs are not bundled in the
installer (its EULA forbids it). Distributed release builds therefore include the
integration but discover a **user-installed** SDK at runtime (`spinnaker_runtime.cpp`,
probing the default path above; override with `PINPOINT_SPINNAKER_ROOT`). End users
install the Spinnaker SDK separately to enable high-speed cameras; without it the app
runs normally minus that backend.

### 5. Aravis (Optional)
Set the `ARAVIS_ROOT` environment variable to your Aravis installation directory.

### 6. OpenCV (Required, 3.0+)
Download from [opencv.org](https://opencv.org/releases/). CMake probes `C:\opencv\build` and `C:\tools\opencv\build` automatically. For a custom location: `-DOpenCV_DIR=C:\path\to\opencv\build`.

### 7. FFmpeg (Optional — swing video export)
The swing-export H.264 encoder needs FFmpeg dev libraries with **libx264**, found via `pkg-config`:

1. **pkg-config**: install one if not present, e.g. `choco install pkgconfiglite` (or [pkgconf](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf)). It must be on PATH at configure time.
2. **FFmpeg**: download a `win64-gpl-shared` build from [BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) (e.g. `ffmpeg-n7.1-latest-win64-gpl-shared-7.1.zip`) and extract it so that `C:\ffmpeg\lib\pkgconfig` exists. CMake probes `C:\ffmpeg` and `C:\tools\ffmpeg`; for a custom location pass `-DFFMPEG_DIR=`. The BtbN shared builds include MSVC import libraries and relocatable `.pc` files — no patching needed. The **gpl** variant is required for libx264 (the project is GPLv2+, so GPL FFmpeg is fine).

The linked FFmpeg DLLs (`avcodec`, `avformat`, `avutil`, `swscale`, `swresample`) are copied next to the executable at POST_BUILD. If FFmpeg was installed after a previous configure, clear the cached probe before reconfiguring:
```
cmake -U "FFMPEG*" -U "__pkg_config_checked_FFMPEG" <builddir>
```

> **windeployqt caveat:** Qt Multimedia bundles its own LGPL FFmpeg with the **same DLL names** (`avcodec-61.dll`, …) but *without* libx264. Running `windeployqt` overwrites the copied DLLs and breaks swing export ("libx264 encoder not available"). After deploying, re-copy the five DLLs from `C:\ffmpeg\bin` over the deployed ones — Qt Multimedia works fine against the GPL build (same ABI, superset of features).

### 8. OpenSSL (Optional — PPCP capture-device link)
`src/Ppcp` speaks TLS with an external pre-shared key, which needs OpenSSL ≥ 1.1.1 headers:
```
vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows
```
then configure with `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`, or point CMake at an existing installation with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=C:\path\to\openssl`. Omit it and the build succeeds with a warning and no PPCP transport; it never falls back to an unencrypted link.

OpenSSL is linked shared and its two DLLs (`libssl-*.dll`, `libcrypto-*.dll`) are copied next to the executable at POST_BUILD, so nothing has to be on PATH. The transport also needs **libppcp** beside this repository — see [Co-developing libppcp](#co-developing-libppcp).

### 9. Bonjour SDK for Windows (Optional — PPCP reconnection discovery)
`src/Ppcp` uses DNS-SD so a remembered phone can find this computer again without a fresh pairing code. Windows has no built-in provider, so the [Bonjour SDK for Windows](https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/) supplies the same `dns_sd.h` API that macOS and Avahi do — one code path, no second backend.

Install it to the default `C:\Program Files\Bonjour SDK`, or set `BONJOUR_SDK_HOME` if it lives elsewhere. Absence is **not** an error: CMake prints a `STATUS` line, the two discovery factories keep returning null, and pairing by code is unaffected (`PPCP-RV` 3.6b).

> `dnssd.lib` is not a conventional import library — every entry point does its own `LoadLibrary` on `dnssd.dll` at call time, so a build machine with the SDK produces a binary that still runs on a machine without Bonjour installed. The **end user** needs `dnssd.dll` (from the *Apple Devices* app, iTunes, or Bonjour Print Services) only if they want reconnection discovery.

### 10. Apple Devices (Runtime only — PPCP wired capture)
The wired link talks to `AppleMobileDeviceService` on `127.0.0.1:27015`, which ships with the Microsoft Store **Apple Devices** app or with iTunes. Nothing is needed at build time — the usbmux client in `src/Ppcp/ppcp_usbmux.cpp` is first-party — and it cannot be redistributed, so an installed build detects its absence and says so in Settings → Phones rather than failing. Loopback needs no firewall rule.

> **The listener does need one.** PPCP over WiFi accepts an incoming TCP connection from the phone, so Windows raises a Security Alert on first run; declining it breaks pairing until the rule is corrected by hand.

---

## Build Instructions

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The Qt prefix is resolved for you: `cmake/PinPointQtPrefix.cmake` takes the
**newest** `~/Qt/<version>/<abi>` that carries a `Qt6Config.cmake`, so installing
a new Qt needs no edit here. Override it only if your Qt lives somewhere else:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.x/<abi>
```

⚠ If a configure fails saying a required Qt **COMPONENT** is missing (`Quick3D`
is the usual one), suspect the prefix before the component. That message is what
you get when CMake finds a *different* Qt — a Homebrew or distro one — rather
than a Qt that is genuinely missing a module. The `-- PinPoint: using Qt prefix …`
line at the top of the configure says which one was picked.

On first configure, CMake downloads all required models and binaries (see table below). Subsequent configures reuse the cache in `build/_deps/` — only a full directory wipe triggers re-downloads.

---

## Packaging & Release (Linux — AppImage with in-app update)

Linux ships as a single self-updating **AppImage** — the native analogue of the
macOS (Sparkle) / Windows (WinSparkle) update story. Design:
[`docs/design/linux_update.md`](docs/design/linux_update.md); build plan:
[`docs/implementation/linux_update_impl.md`](docs/implementation/linux_update_impl.md).

**Build the AppImage:**
```bash
# Host tools (once): linuxdeploy, linuxdeploy-plugin-qt, appimagetool,
# appimageupdatetool, zsync (zsyncmake). All from the AppImageCommunity releases.
export SIGN_KEY=<your-release-gpg-key-fpr>
export CMAKE_PREFIX=~/Qt/6.11.1/gcc_64
export CUDA_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-12/lib64   # for GPU ORT
export CUDNN_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu # cuDNN 9
tools/package_appimage.sh                      # → dist/PinPointStudio-<ver>-x86_64.AppImage{,.zsync,.sig}
tools/package_appimage.sh --no-sign            # unsigned dev build (no in-app update trust)
```

The script resolves the version from `src/Core/version.h`, builds Release, bundles
Qt/QML + the heavy native deps (ORT, the **x264-capable** FFmpeg — same trap as the
`windeployqt` x264 note in the Windows section, OpenCV, Aravis, espeak-ng,
CUDA/cuDNN, optional Spinnaker) + the `appimageupdatetool` binary the app shells out
to, then
seals with `appimagetool` embedding the `gh-releases-zsync` update information and a
GPG signature.

> **Not yet validated end-to-end.** As of this commit the script encodes the recipe
> but has not been run on a clean VM (the dev host lacks the AppImage tooling). The
> P0 acceptance gate (clean-Ubuntu launch with BLE + cameras + GPU + x264 export) is
> still open — see the impl plan.

**Releasing:** tag exactly the `version.h` string (e.g. `v0.1-alpha1`) and push;
CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, P2) builds, signs, and attaches the three
artifacts to the GitHub Release. The in-app updater polls that release feed.

---

## Packaging & Release (macOS — DMG with in-app update)

macOS ships as a Developer ID-signed, notarized **`.app` inside a `.dmg`**, kept up to
date in place by **Sparkle** (the framework WinSparkle is a port of), gated by a pinned
**EdDSA (Ed25519)** signature. Design:
[`docs/design/macos_update.md`](docs/design/macos_update.md) ·
**release runbook:** [`docs/implementation/macos_release_runbook.md`](docs/implementation/macos_release_runbook.md).

**Build the DMG:**
```bash
# Build deps come from Homebrew (CMake probes them): opencv@4, ffmpeg, aravis.
#   brew install opencv@4 ffmpeg aravis
# NB opencv@4, NOT opencv — the plain formula is 5.x now, which moves calib3d into
# separate 3d/calib modules and does not build here. CMake asks for opencv@4 by name
# (it is keg-only, so `brew --prefix opencv` cannot see it) and rejects 5.x explicitly.
tools/package_macos.sh                         # → dist/PinPointStudio-<ver>-<arch>.dmg (signs+notarizes if creds set)
tools/package_macos.sh --no-sign               # unsigned dev build (no in-app update trust)
tools/package_macos.sh --app <prebuilt.app>    # package an already-built .app (copied, never mutated)
tools/package_macos.sh --check-only            # re-run ONLY the verification gate on the staged bundle
```
The DMG is named from the **built binary**, not from the build host: `lipo -archs` on the
staged executable decides the `-x86_64` / `-arm64` suffix, and the script refuses a
universal binary (one arch per DMG — the two architectures ship different ONNX Runtime
majors). It also cross-checks the Sparkle feed baked into `Info.plist` against that arch
and aborts on a mismatch, which is what a stale CMake cache produces.
The script resolves the version from `src/Core/version.h`, builds Release, runs
`macdeployqt`, then **recursively relocates the Homebrew dependency closure** macdeployqt
leaves half-done (OpenCV → VTK → webp; the Qt sql plugin → libmimerapi) into
`Contents/Frameworks` with `@rpath` install names, and **verifies** the bundle before
building the DMG (the clean-host gate, which fails loudly). The gate makes two passes: no
Mach-O may keep an **absolute** dependency outside `/usr/lib` and `/System` (an allow-list —
a deny-list of Homebrew prefixes missed Qt's psql plugin linking a `/Applications/Postgres.app`
path), and every **`@rpath` dependency must actually resolve** inside the bundle, resolved
the way dyld does — including the main executable's `LC_RPATH`s, which is how dlopen'd Qt
plugins find their frameworks. That second pass is what catches a dylib correctly rewritten
to `@rpath` but never copied in, or copied in under a name nothing asks for. With a
**Developer ID Application** identity in the keychain and a `NOTARY_PROFILE`, it also
codesigns (Hardened Runtime, entitlements at `packaging/macos/entitlements.plist`),
notarizes, and staples; without them it emits a valid **unsigned** DMG.

- **Two DMGs, two feeds** — `PinPointStudio-<ver>-x86_64.dmg` → `appcast-mac.xml`, and
  `PinPointStudio-<ver>-arm64.dmg` → `appcast-mac-arm64.xml`. Each architecture's binary
  only ever sees its own feed; there is no arch negotiation inside a feed (Sparkle has no
  such attribute). **`appcast-mac.xml` is a frozen name** — it is baked into the
  `Info.plist` of every Intel install in the field and Sparkle re-reads it from the
  *installed* bundle, so renaming it for symmetry would orphan them permanently.
  There is **no CUDA / no component split** on macOS — the DMG is the whole,
  hardware-agnostic app (acceleration is CoreML/Accelerate/Metal).
- **The two builds are not equivalent.** arm64 gets ONNX Runtime 1.26 with the CoreML
  execution provider **and ORT-GenAI (local LLM)**; x86_64 is pinned to ORT **1.20.1**, CPU
  only, with **no local LLM** (it falls back to Gemini). This is not a choice — Microsoft
  stopped shipping Intel macOS prebuilts for both after ORT 1.21 / ORT-GenAI 0.11.4, so the
  gap widens with every release. Intel is also on a clock at the CI end: GitHub retires
  x86_64 macOS runners in **August 2027**.
- **The shipped minimum macOS is set by the build host, not by us.** Homebrew bottles are
  compiled for the packaging machine's macOS, so a DMG built on a macOS 26 Mac requires
  macOS 26 whatever `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` says. `package_macos.sh` therefore
  *computes* the floor (the highest `LC_BUILD_VERSION` minos across everything bundled),
  stamps it as `LSMinimumSystemVersion`, and `make_appcast_mac.sh` reads it back out of the
  DMG it is about to sign. **Ship CI-built DMGs**, not locally-built ones, unless you intend
  the floor your own Mac imposes.
- Developer ID signing + notarization are a **v1 requirement** on macOS (not optional
  polish): an un-notarized app is quarantined and App Translocation stops Sparkle updating
  in place. The cert + notary credential + the EdDSA private key all stay **offline, never
  CI secrets**.

> **Status:** shipping. A Developer ID-signed, notarized, **Sparkle-capable** DMG (with the
> in-app updater embedded and the real pinned EdDSA key) + an EdDSA-signed `appcast-mac.xml`
> are published on the `v0.1-alpha3` release. Still open: the clean-second-Mac acceptance
> gate (BLE + camera + STT + CoreML + x264 export, no Gatekeeper warning) and a real
> update-**offer** test (needs a higher-versioned release, since Sparkle offers only when
> `sparkle:version` strictly exceeds the installed `CFBundleVersion`) — see the impl plan
> [`docs/implementation/macos_update_impl.md`](docs/implementation/macos_update_impl.md).

**Releasing:** tag exactly the `version.h` string (e.g. `v0.1-alpha3`) and push; CI's
`macos` job is a **two-leg matrix** — `x86_64` on `macos-15-intel` and `arm64` on
`macos-15` — and each leg builds its **unsigned** DMG and stages it on the same **draft**
release. `fail-fast: false`, so a flaky leg cannot cancel the other one's good DMG; a
`macos-assets-complete` job then refuses to go green unless **both** DMGs are on the draft,
because a feed whose architecture has no enclosure is invisible in the GitHub UI. The
maintainer signs + notarizes each exact DMG locally and runs `make_appcast_mac.sh --arch`
**once per architecture**, uploads all four assets, and publishes non-prerelease — full
steps in the runbook.

---

## Packaging & Release (Windows — Installer with in-app update)

Windows ships as a per-user **Inno Setup installer** kept up to date in place by
**WinSparkle** (the Windows analogue of macOS Sparkle / the Linux AppImage updater),
gated by a pinned **EdDSA (Ed25519)** signature. Design:
[`docs/design/windows_update.md`](docs/design/windows_update.md); build plan:
[`docs/implementation/windows_update_impl.md`](docs/implementation/windows_update_impl.md);
**release runbook:** [`docs/implementation/windows_release_runbook.md`](docs/implementation/windows_release_runbook.md).

### Prerequisites
- **Inno Setup 6** (`ISCC.exe`) — `choco install innosetup` or [jrsoftware.org](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).
- The Release build toolchain (VS 2022, Qt 6.11 MSVC, CMake) from the Windows section above.
- `WinSparkle` (incl. `winsparkle-tool.exe` for key-gen/sign/verify) is fetched by
  CMake — no manual install.

### Build the installer
```powershell
# Default: core + cuda in one installer (large, ~1.8 GB).
pwsh -File packaging\build_installer.ps1
# Small core-only installer — this is the WinSparkle auto-update payload:
pwsh -File packaging\build_installer.ps1 -Components core
# Standalone NVIDIA CUDA runtime (its OWN Inno AppId; same install dir as core):
pwsh -File packaging\build_installer.ps1 -Components cuda
```
The installer is **per-user / no-UAC** (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`) precisely so the
in-app updater can replace files with no elevation. The version comes from
`src/Core/version.h` (CMake derives `project(VERSION) = MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD` from it —
bump `version.h` only).

### Components & the auto-update payload
- **core** — app + Qt + ORT (incl. the CUDA provider DLLs) + OpenCV + FFmpeg +
  models. Hardware-agnostic; runs CPU or GPU. **This is the only thing
  WinSparkle updates.** (The Spinnaker SDK is *not* bundled — it is delay-loaded and
  discovered at runtime from a user-installed SDK; see §4.)
- **cuda** — the NVIDIA CUDA + cuDNN runtime, packaged under its **own stable AppId**
  so a `-core` auto-update never touches it. It is **not** in the appcast: the app
  detects an NVIDIA GPU (`nvcuda.dll`) and whether the runtime is present
  (`cudnn64_9.dll` next to the exe) and offers **Settings → General → GPU acceleration
  → Install** when a GPU is present but the runtime isn't — so users who add a GPU
  later adapt with no reinstall (design §4.4).

### Releasing (in-app update)
The full per-release procedure — bump version, build the `-core` installer, sign it
offline with the EdDSA key, generate `appcast-win.xml` (`packaging\make_appcast.ps1`),
upload, and publish — is in the
**[Windows Release Runbook](docs/implementation/windows_release_runbook.md)**. The
signing key never leaves your machine (it is not a CI secret); the pinned public half
lives at `src/Resources/keys/pinpoint_release_win_eddsa.pub` and is compiled into the
app. WinSparkle points at the stable
`releases/latest/download/appcast-win.xml` redirect, so releases must be published
**non-prerelease** for it to resolve.

> **Not yet validated end-to-end.** As of this commit the WinSparkle wiring, signing
> scripts, and CI Windows job are authored but the pinned key is still a placeholder
> (the updater is inert until a real key ships) and the CI job + the CUDA `AppId`
> split await a first run / clean-VM validation — see the impl plan.

## Testing

PinPoint Studio has nine standalone unit-test suites. **None are part of the application build** — the root `CMakeLists.txt` forces `BUILD_TESTING OFF`, so building the app never compiles them. Each suite recompiles only the handful of `.cpp` it needs (there is no test-linkable library except `pinpoint_buffer`) and stubs out anything that would drag in the heavy app dependencies — so the tests configure and build in seconds, independent of whisper/FFmpeg/OpenCV.

> The Gui suite is the one exception to "independent of QML": its offscreen UI tests declare the app's QML module themselves so they can press real components. That costs a QML compile, and it is what puts UI coverage in the release gate — the suite previously lived in the app build and therefore ran in no gate on any platform.

There are two ways to build and run them: the **umbrella** (all suites in one configure/build/ctest) and **per-suite standalone** (fastest single-suite iteration). Both use the shared CMake infrastructure in `tests/`. For the architecture, `pp_add_test` reference, and how to add a test or a new suite, see **[docs/developer/testing_developer_guide.md](docs/developer/testing_developer_guide.md)**.

> On Windows/MSVC: the Analysis and Pose suites need `-DOpenCV_DIR=C:/tools/opencv/build` at configure (the app's OpenCV auto-probe is not in the test projects), and ctest needs Qt's `bin` plus OpenCV's `bin` on `PATH` or the test exes fail with `0xc0000135` (DLL not found).

### Run all suites (umbrella)

```bash
cmake -S tests -B build/tests
cmake --build build/tests -j6
ctest --test-dir build/tests --output-on-failure
```

The Qt prefix is auto-resolved per platform; pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.x/<abi>` only if Qt is installed somewhere non-standard. Eigen, libwrist and libgspro are found automatically (explicit `-DPP_EIGEN_DIR` / `-DPP_LIBWRIST_DIR` / `-DPP_LIBGSPRO_DIR`, then a sibling checkout or the app build's `build/*/_deps/…`, then a fetch) — configuring the app once first lets the tests reuse its copies with no extra download.

> **⚠ An incremental umbrella can report green while testing stale binaries.** Re-using an existing `build/tests` is fine for day-to-day iteration, but it will happily print `100% tests passed` over executables built from an older checkout. Observed 2026-08-16: a run over a pre-existing `build/tests` reported 134/134, and `rm -rf build/tests` followed by a clean reconfigure **at the same commit** immediately surfaced a failure. **Delete `build/tests` before any run whose result you intend to rely on** — cutting a release, confirming a fix, or declaring a suite green. The release runbooks now do this as part of the mandatory gate.

Equivalent via the presets in `tests/CMakePresets.json` (CMake reads `CMakePresets.json` from the current directory, so run them **from `tests/`**):

```bash
cd tests
cmake --preset tests && cmake --build --preset tests && ctest --preset tests
```

**Sanitizers** are a single knob shared by every suite — use a separate build dir per config:

```bash
cmake -S tests -B build/tests-asan -DPP_SANITIZE="address;undefined"   # ASan + UBSan
cmake -S tests -B build/tests-tsan -DPP_SANITIZE=thread                # ThreadSanitizer
# (or the tests-asan / tests-tsan presets, run from tests/)
```

### Run a single suite (standalone)

Each suite's `src/<Sub>/tests/CMakeLists.txt` also configures on its own — same file, no umbrella required:

```bash
cmake -S src/IMU/tests -B build/imu-tests
cmake --build build/imu-tests -j6
ctest --test-dir build/imu-tests --output-on-failure
```

Filter within any built tree with `ctest --test-dir <build> -R <regex>`.

### Suite catalog

| Suite | Source root | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EventBuffer** | `src/Buffer/tests` | 8 | Lock-free ring, timeline merger, swing window, wait-flag, watchdog, thread-policy + adversarial producer/consumer fuzz. GoogleTest; links the `pinpoint_buffer` library. |
| **Analysis** | `src/Analysis/tests` | 28 | Wrist Motion assessment engine (bands, Tier-1/Tier-2 rules, composite score v2, live adapter); segmentation chain (phase signals/segmenter, metric extractor, swing scorer); wrist-angle math; IMU anatomical calibration; orientation filters (Madgwick + ESKF); WT9011DCL/WT901BLE67 driver frame-parse; 3D-viz binding; ShaftTracker (radial detection, track assembly, kinematics); shot arbiter; session summary; frame decode; `swing.json` round-trip. |
| **Resource profiler** | `src/Core/tests` | 7 | `pp_profiler`/`pp_os_metrics`/`PpStatsLog` + the `profiler_controller` bridge: tier gating, scope interning, timing aggregation, concurrency, OS/GPU metrics graceful degradation, zero-overhead compile-out. GoogleTest; on Windows links `dxgi`. |
| **Gui model/helper + QML UI** | `src/Gui/tests` | 7 | `TimelineLabels` (label solver, nearest/active, phase names), `ChartMetrics::seriesGroups` against the real manifest, `SwingSeriesModel` (playhead→row), `ShotListModel::shotSummary`, `ReanalysisController`, and `qml_reactivity_test` (reads source for bindings that subscribe to nothing). Plus **`qml_ui`**: 11 `tst_*.qml` that load real components offscreen and press them — the only coverage of the QML↔C++ seam and of the layouts. It declares the app's QML module from `cmake/PinPointQmlModule.cmake` and loads the app's bundled fonts, so it measures the faces the app ships rather than a host fallback. Needs Qt6 Qml/Quick/QuickTest/Multimedia/GuiPrivate. |
| **Shot impact-detector** | `src/IMU/tests` | 3 | IMU impact detector truth table (fires once; taps/waggles/swells rejected; refractory; orientation gate; back-dated `est_t`; 100↔200 Hz parity); `ImuIoWorker` thread/EventBuffer contract; ESKF gyro-unit pin. |
| **Calibrated ball-detection** | `src/Pose/tests` | 3 | `ball_model.h` core (model fitting, theta, multi-cue scoring, gain invariance, drift); calibration protocol (round bookkeeping, profile save/load); `BallDetector` throttle contract. Needs OpenCV (core/imgproc/features2d). |
| **Acoustic onset-detector** | `src/Audio/tests` | 1 | Onset detector truth table (click fires sample-accurately; speech/tone/ambient rejected; refractory; back-dating; reverb confirm; absolute amplitude gate). |
| **Launch monitor** | `src/LaunchMonitor/tests` | 6 | `LastShot.CSV` parsing (columns matched by name not position, metric **and** imperial units as FSX2020 declares them, the three derived values, malformed/torn/short input) and shot attribution (`ShotPairing` arming and displacement, parking a reading until a `swingDir` exists, and the watermark that stops a stale file being claimed at startup). Plus the standalone gate — whether a reading nothing else saw becomes a shot of its own — exhaustive over all 2^7 precondition states, split out of the controller so it needs no CameraManager. GoogleTest; the pairing half writes its own fixtures into a `QTemporaryDir` and needs Qt6 Test for `QSignalSpy`. Plus the GSPro Open Connect connector: the libgspro link/ABI check (that the dependency links and its headers match its archive), the `gsp_message` → reading mapping against real clients' byte patterns (presence bits, a measured zero, a back/side-spin-only device, units, the derived values), and the listener itself over a loopback socket — a shot becoming a reading and being acknowledged, a heartbeat answered but not attributed, a message split across three writes, two devices at once, a client vanishing mid-message, and a bind conflict reported rather than swallowed. |
| **In-app update** | `src/Update/tests` | 3 | Linux updater pure logic (version compare, AppImage asset selection across x86_64/aarch64, GPG VALIDSIG parse, placeholder-key refusal); `PlatformTarget` arch-token map + a tripwire on the **frozen** macOS appcast filenames (`appcast-mac.xml` must stay unsuffixed; arm64 is a separate file); `UpdateController` state-machine + relaunch session-safety policy + QML state-string contract, driven by a `FakeUpdateBackend`. GoogleTest; the policy test needs Qt6 Qml + Test. |

Framework note: Buffer, Core, In-app update and Launch monitor use GoogleTest (fetched automatically); the other five use a self-contained `main()` + `CHECK`/`CHECK_NEAR` (no GoogleTest). `src/Buffer/tests` also builds `latency_benchmark`, intentionally **not** registered with CTest — run it by hand: `./build/tests/Buffer/latency_benchmark` (umbrella) or `./build/buffer-tests/tests/latency_benchmark` (standalone `-S src/Buffer`).

## Automatically Downloaded Dependencies

The following are fetched at `cmake ..` time — no manual steps required:

| Dependency | What | Cached size | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| ONNX Runtime 1.26.0 | Prebuilt shared library (platform/CUDA matched) | ~10–80 MB | Always |
| ONNX Runtime GenAI 0.13.1 | Prebuilt shared library (local LLM engine; CUDA or CPU variant) | ~10–60 MB | `WITH_ORTGENAI=ON` (default; auto-off on Intel macOS) |

| Eigen 3.4.0 | Header-only (IMU EKF) | ~few MB | Always |
| libwrist (`main`) | Built from source (HackMotion wG3 wrist sensor) | ~2 MB | Always — unless a sibling `../libwrist` checkout is found, see below |
| libgspro (`main`) | Built from source (GSPro Open Connect launch monitor server) | ~1 MB | Always — unless a sibling `../libgspro` checkout is found, see below |
| `ggml-base.en.bin` | Whisper STT model (Hugging Face) | ~148 MB | Always |

| yt-dlp | Platform binary for YouTube download | ~15 MB | Always |

If a download fails, the affected feature is disabled but the rest of the build continues normally. Re-run CMake to retry failed downloads.

> **Not downloaded at build time:**
> - **libppcp** — the PPCP protocol library needs a sibling `../libppcp` checkout; auto-fetch is off while the repository is private. See [Co-developing libppcp](#co-developing-libppcp).
> - The local LLM model (Phi-4-mini) is fetched by the app itself on first run — into the per-user app-data directory, and only when a compatible GPU is present.
> - **ViTPose++-L wholebody** (`vitpose-l-wholebody.onnx`, ~1.2 GB) — the "High" motion-capture-quality pose model. Deliberately never built or packaged; the app downloads it on demand (with an explicit size warning) when the user selects the **High** tier in Settings → General, into `AppLocalDataLocation/models/vitpose/`. "High" runs ViTPose++-L; "Low"/"Medium" run the packaged ViTPose-B.

### Co-developing libwrist

[libwrist](https://github.com/PinPoint-Golf/libwrist) is a sister project rather than a
frozen third-party dependency, so the build is set up for a fix-and-push loop against it.

**Source resolution**, in order:

1. A sibling checkout at `../libwrist` (i.e. next to the PinPoint repo) — used automatically
   whenever it exists. CMake prints which source won and the exact commit:
   `-- libwrist: 0.1.0 (5caec2e, local) — local /home/markl/Projects/libwrist`
2. Otherwise `main` from GitHub, re-fetched on every reconfigure.

Pass `-DPP_LIBWRIST_LOCAL=OFF` to ignore a sibling checkout and always take upstream.

**Make fixes in the sibling checkout and push from there.** It is an ordinary git clone with its own
`origin`; PinPoint builds against it directly, so a change is picked up by the next build with no
CMake edit and no re-fetch. ⚠ **Never edit the fetched copy under `build/*/_deps/wrist-src`** —
it is a shallow clone, FetchContent's update step overwrites local changes on reconfigure, and
`rm -rf build` destroys them. This is CMake's own recommendation for exactly this workflow (see
`FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<name>`).

The resolved version *and commit* appear in the About box, because the dependency tracks a branch
and can be overridden locally — the version string alone does not identify a build. The umbrella
test suite resolves the library the same way and adds `-DPP_LIBWRIST_DIR=<path>` for an explicit
override; `ctest -R hackmotion` runs the link/ABI check.

The dependency tracks `main` deliberately while the HackMotion integration lands. It reverts to a
tag pin once the library stabilises.

### Co-developing libppcp

[libppcp](https://github.com/PinPoint-Golf/libppcp) is the sans-I/O C11 implementation of the
PinPoint Capture Protocol, shared between PinPoint Studio and the PinPoint Capture phone app. It
is embedded exactly as libwrist is, with one difference that matters today:

⚠ **It is not fetched automatically.** `PP_LIBPPCP_FETCH` defaults **OFF** while the repository is
private, so libppcp resolves *only* from a sibling checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PinPoint-Golf/libppcp   # beside this repository
```

With no sibling checkout, CMake prints `libppcp: not embedded` and — regardless of OpenSSL — the
PPCP transport is not built, so the app has no phone support. Pass `-DPP_LIBPPCP_FETCH=ON` to take
`main` from GitHub instead (the default flips to ON once the repository is public), or
`-DPP_LIBPPCP_LOCAL=OFF` to ignore a sibling checkout and always take upstream.

The same fix-and-push rule as libwrist applies: edit the sibling clone, never the fetched copy
under `build/*/_deps/`. The resolved version and commit appear in the About box and in the
configure log (`PPCP transport: OpenSSL …, libppcp …`).

### Co-developing libgspro

[libgspro](https://github.com/PinPoint-Golf/libgspro) is the sans-I/O C11 server for the **GSPro
Open Connect v1** protocol. ⚠ Very few launch monitors speak it themselves — somebody wrote a
bridge that speaks it on the device's behalf, and the library's survey found seventeen: five
independent ones for the Garmin R10, two for the Rapsodo MLM2PRO, one for a SkyTrak+ via
OpenSkyPlus, one off a Foresight GC2's serial feed, an SLX proxy, and PiTrac and OpenFlight which
are native clients. Speaking the *server* side of it is what lets one connector receive shots from
all of them, which is why it is a dependency rather than a parser per device.

⚠ **Uneekor, Bushnell and Foresight ship no Open Connect client**, so this does not replace the
GCQuad connector: those devices' own connectors are closed and speak their vendors' simulators,
and a Uneekor is reachable only through a third-party bridge that watches Uneekor VIEW's shot
folder.

It is embedded **exactly as libwrist is**, with no differences: the repository is public, so it is
fetched when no sibling checkout is present and the build works on a machine that has never heard
of it.

1. A sibling checkout at `../libgspro` — used automatically, and it **wins**:
   ```
   -- libgspro: 0.1.0 (48f70ed, local) — local /home/markl/Projects/libgspro
   ```
2. Otherwise `main` from GitHub, re-fetched on every reconfigure.

Pass `-DPP_LIBGSPRO_LOCAL=OFF` to ignore a sibling checkout and always take upstream.

⚠ **Neither of the library's optional modules is built.** It ships a reference socket transport
(`GS_BUILD_NET`) and a `.gswire` byte recorder (`GS_BUILD_RECORD`); both stay off. PinPoint owns
the `QTcpServer`, the host clock and the storage — that split is the whole point of a sans-I/O
library, and linking a `select()` loop into an application that already has an event loop is the
mistake it exists to make impossible.

The same fix-and-push rule applies: edit the sibling clone, never the fetched copy under
`build/*/_deps/gspro-src`. The resolved version and commit appear in the configure log and the
About box, because the dependency tracks a branch and a local checkout can override it.

The umbrella test suite resolves the library the same way and adds `-DPP_LIBGSPRO_DIR=<path>` for
an explicit override; `ctest -R gspro` runs the link/ABI check — which is what makes "the
dependency was added for Linux, macOS and Windows" a claim rather than an expectation, since no
PinPoint code references a libgspro symbol until the connector lands.

## GPU Acceleration Summary by Platform

| Feature | Windows CUDA 12 | Windows CUDA 13 | Linux CUDA 12 | Linux (Intel GPU) | macOS ARM64 | macOS Intel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Whisper STT | Vulkan or CUDA | Vulkan or CUDA | Vulkan or CUDA | Vulkan (Intel ANV) | Metal | CPU |
| Kokoro TTS (ORT) | CUDA | CUDA | CUDA | CPU | CoreML | CPU |
| MoveNet pose (ORT) | CUDA | CUDA | CUDA | CPU | CoreML | CPU |
| Person segmenter (ORT) | CUDA | CUDA | CUDA | CPU | CoreML | CPU |
| Local LLM (ORT GenAI) | CUDA | CUDA | CUDA | Gemini cloud¹ | built-in | Gemini cloud¹ |

¹ Without a local GPU (or on Intel macOS, where ORT GenAI has no prebuilt) the app skips the local Phi-4-mini download and uses the Gemini cloud backend instead.

Vulkan is preferred over CUDA for Whisper because it works across GPU vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel Arc) without needing the CUDA Toolkit. The Intel ANV Vulkan driver covers integrated graphics on Linux (UHD, Iris, Xe); Intel Arc discrete cards also work via Vulkan.

ORT on Linux with Intel integrated graphics runs on CPU — see the note above on why OpenVINO EP is not supported.

---

## Build Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-DWITH_CUDA=ON/OFF` | ON | Enable CUDA EP for ONNX Runtime. Windows: auto-disabled to the CPU package when no CUDA 12/13 toolkit matches. Linux: always fetches the CUDA-12 GPU package (no version probe — see [Linux GPU notes](#4-gpu-acceleration-optional)) |
| `-DWITH_COREML=ON/OFF` | ON | Enable CoreML EP on macOS ARM64 |
| `-DWITH_VITPOSE=ON/OFF` | ON | Download and build ViTPose-B wholebody pose estimator (~330 MB model) |
| `-DWITH_MEDIAPIPE=ON/OFF` | OFF | Build MediaPipe BlazePose estimator (requires Python 3.10–3.13 + `qai-hub-models`, `torch`, `onnxscript`) |
| `-DWITH_ORTGENAI=ON/OFF` | ON | ONNX Runtime GenAI local LLM engine (auto-off on Intel macOS — falls back to Gemini cloud) |
| `-DPINPOINT_BUILD_TOOLS=ON/OFF` | OFF | Build the SwingLab offline analysis tools (`swinglab_run`) — see below |
| `-DPINPOINT_DEBUG_LEVEL=<n>` | 1 | Log verbosity (2 = startup info + warnings/errors) |
| `-DASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=<key>` | — | Seed AssemblyAI API key into settings at build time |
| `-DOpenCV_DIR=<path>` | — | Path to OpenCV CMake config (Windows, non-standard location) |
| `-DFFMPEG_DIR=<path>` | — | FFmpeg root for swing export (Windows, non-standard location; must contain `lib/pkgconfig`) |

---

## SwingLab Offline Tools (Optional)

`swinglab_run` replays a recorded swing directory through the **production** analysis pipeline (same sources, same configs) with JSON-injectable tuning parameters and per-frame trace dumps — used for parameter sweeps and regression triage. It is **not built by default**; enable it with `-DPINPOINT_BUILD_TOOLS=ON`:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt/6.11.x/compiler_arch -DPINPOINT_BUILD_TOOLS=ON
cmake --build . --target swinglab_run
```

It shares the app's heavy dependency set (OpenCV incl. videoio, ONNX Runtime, the ViTPose model), so configure the app at least once first to ensure those are present.

## Film Tab — YouTube Download

The Film tab uses a bundled **yt-dlp** binary to download YouTube videos to a local cache. No separate yt-dlp installation is needed.

To use YouTube Premium quality, log into YouTube in your browser before downloading — the app reads your browser's cookies. On Linux, Brave is the recommended browser; Chrome and Chromium require the `secretstorage` Python module which is not available in the bundled binary.
