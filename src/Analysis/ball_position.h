// Ball position at address — where the ball sits along the stance, as a fraction
// of the lead-heel→trail-heel line:
//
//     v    = trailHeel − leadHeel
//     frac = dot(ball − leadHeel, v) / |v|²
//
// 0 = at the lead heel, 1 = at the trail heel. DELIBERATELY UNCLAMPED: a ball
// forward of the lead heel (frac < 0) is a real, coachable driver setup, not an
// error to be squashed. Reported as a percentage.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE SCALE-FREE METRIC. The denominator is exactly foot_metrics'
// stanceWidth measurement — the same Euclidean heel-to-heel distance over the
// same address reference frames — so the two agree by construction. Both are px
// distances in the SAME image plane at the SAME depth, so their RATIO needs no
// px→mm scale factor and is genuinely comparable across captures, framings and
// focal lengths. (Stance width in absolute units is not: it needs the ball ruler
// below, which carries the ball-radius measurement error.)
//
// ROBUST ADDRESS BALL CENTRE. Component-wise median of the `found` samples inside
// the address window, then a cluster gate about that median. This mirrors
// ball_anchor.cpp's medianGripBallLenPx pass 1 deliberately, and for the reason
// documented there: a component-wise median is ORDER-INDEPENDENT, so a detector
// warm-up mis-lock on the opening frames cannot veto every later good sample the
// way a first-accepted chain gate can (observed on the 2026-07-04 corpus).
//
// DUPLICATION, ACKNOWLEDGED. medianGripBallLenPx already computes this exact
// (medX, medY) internally and then discards it — it returns only the grip→ball
// length. Plumbing it out would mean widening the shaft tracker's frozen
// decideTrack internals for a metric that needs none of the rest; recomputing ~10
// lines here against the same convention is the cheaper, lower-risk choice. If a
// third consumer ever appears, factor it out the way buildThetaBallSeries was.
//
// The pass also yields the ball-diameter px→mm ruler as a by-product (the ball's
// real diameter is a fixed R&A/USGA spec), which foot_metrics uses to express
// stance width in mm. That ruler is exact only at the ball's ground-plane depth —
// which face-on is essentially the feet's depth, so it is the RIGHT ruler for
// stance geometry, but it rests on a ~9.5 px radius measurement and so carries
// roughly 10 % scale error per ±1 px of radius error. Median it, never trust one
// frame, and treat mm stance width as an estimate rather than a calibration.
