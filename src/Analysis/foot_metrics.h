// Setup + footwork metrics (WB3, wholebody_pose_design.md §2.1/§5). Structure
// mirrors head_track.h deliberately (same shape: a per-frame state pass, a
// robust Address reference, Address-referenced sparse channels, a MetricSeries
// builder) — pure, deterministic, Qt-only (no OpenCV/ORT); unit-tested
// standalone.
//
// It reads only the COCO-WholeBody foot keypoints: L-bigtoe(17)/L-heel(19),
// R-bigtoe(20)/R-heel(22) — heel + bigtoe of a foot must BOTH clear the
// confidence gate for that foot to contribute anything this frame (every
// derived quantity below — stance width, flare, toe-line, heel-lift — needs
// both points of at least one foot). Legacy tracks analysed before WB0 (17 kp,
// conf[17..] defaulted to 0) therefore never clear the gate ⇒ trackFeet()
// leaves `valid` false and buildFootSeries() emits nothing (no output, never
// garbage) — the same contract head_track.h has for an all-low-confidence
// track.
//
// "Lead" foot follows the SAME handedness convention already established for
// the lead arm (pose_runner.cpp: `leftLeads = (handedness != 2)`,
// metric_extractor.cpp: `leftArm = (handedness != 2)`) — the caller resolves
// `leadIsLeft` once and passes it in; this module does not read handedness
// itself.
//
// SCALAR-METRIC REPRESENTATION (design decision — see wrist_analyzer.cpp
// integration + docs/reference/swing_json_schema.md 2026-07-13 note): stance
// width / per-foot flare / toe-line angle are ONE measurement each, taken at
// address — not a per-frame curve. No dedicated "scalar metric" shape exists
// anywhere in the codebase (ScoreBreakdown::metrics / ScoredMetric is scorer-
// internal audit trail and is never serialized to swing.json at all — see
// swing_doc.cpp's serializeScore(), which has no analogue of `metrics`).
// MetricSeries, by contrast, is already the one persisted/consumed shape
// (swing_doc.cpp, disk_replay_source.cpp, shot_processor.cpp, PpMetricChart),
// and every one of those readers/writers loops over `t_us`/`value`/
// `phaseSamples` generically with no non-empty-curve assumption. So the setup
// scalars use the representation that contract ALREADY tolerates cleanly: a
// MetricSeries with an EMPTY `t_us`/`value` curve and a single Address
// `phaseSamples` entry carrying the one measurement. This needs no
// reader/writer change anywhere (swing_doc.cpp is explicitly off-limits for
// this packet) and keeps each scalar's own key/label/unit — cramming multiple
// unrelated quantities into one series' phaseSamples (or inventing a bespoke
// "setup" block) was rejected as it would corrupt the existing convention that
// a series' phaseSamples are the SAME quantity sampled at different phases.
// `leadHeelLift` is a genuine per-frame curve and uses the normal shape,
// identical to head_track's sway/lift.
//
// ISOTROPY: like head_track.h, all geometry (distances, angles) is computed in
// PIXELS via (frameW, frameH) separately, then any px DISTANCE is re-normalized
// by the SINGLE reference dimension frameW (matching head_track's sway/lift
// convention) so `stanceWidth`/`leadHeelLift` are isotropic "×frame" units.
// Angles are dimensionless degrees and need no re-normalization.
