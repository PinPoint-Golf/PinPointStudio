// Tempo metrics — the two "free" segmentation-only summaries (shot_analyzer_design
// §A.6): how long the backswing takes, and the ratio between the two halves of the
// swing. Pure over a resolved Segmentation: no window, no context, no pose, no
// club. Deliberately the event_refine.{h,cpp} shape — engine here, ~20 lines of
// stage glue in wrist_analyzer.cpp.
//
// BASIS — Address→Top, NOT Takeaway→Top:
//
//     B (backswing) = Top    − Address
//     D (downswing) = Impact − Top
//     R (ratio)     = B / D
//
// This matches the metric catalogue's own descriptions of tempoBackswing /
// tempoRatio. Be aware it DIFFERS from the Takeaway-based definition used by the
// golf literature the reference band comes from (Tour Tempo / TPI: backswing
// 0.847 ± 0.111 s, ratio ~3:1, good players ~2.2–3.0:1), so this basis reads
// slightly HIGH against those figures by the Address→Takeaway gap. That gap is
// structurally small — Address ≤ Takeaway by construction on both ladders (the
// vision Address is the address-hold END and Takeaway is motion onset at bs0;
// the IMU Address is the end of the stillness run) — but it has never been
// measured, so tempoRatio's corridor is provisional until the corpus supplies
// the distribution.
//
// REFUSAL, NOT APPROXIMATION. The IMU segmenter has a documented degenerate path
// (phase_segmenter.cpp clampFallback) that emits ONLY {Address, Impact, Finish}
// with conf 0 and Address pinned to the window edge — no Top at all. A conf gate
// plus a hard "all three events present" check means an untrustworthy ladder
// produces NO series rather than a plausible-looking wrong number. Same contract
// as foot_metrics/head_track: no output beats garbage output.
//
// UNCERTAINTY. Top sits in BOTH the numerator and the denominator with opposite
// sign, so its timing error is doubly leveraged: a 30 ms Top error — exactly the
// validation plan's ≤30 ms target — moves the ratio ~15 %, over half the width of
// the whole 2.2–3.0:1 band. Real-capture Top error has never been characterised
// (the target is documented; no measured result exists). So every emitted series
// carries a propagated 1σ in MetricSeries::sigma, following score_uncertainty.h's
// rule that low confidence WIDENS the interval and never moves the central value.
