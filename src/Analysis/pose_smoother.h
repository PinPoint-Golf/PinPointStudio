// Motion-overlay pose smoother (Phase 1) — an offline, NON-CAUSAL RTS smoother
// for the 133 COCO-WholeBody keypoints of a PoseTrack2D (0–16 the unchanged
// COCO body joints, tail = feet/face/hands — swing_analysis.h kWholeBodyJoints).
// It is a deliberate sibling of the clubhead Stage-2 temporal model
// (clubhead_track.h — HeadKf1D + runHeadTemporal): the same segmented-Kalman +
// per-segment RTS + honesty-tier idioms, taken one derivative order up. Where
// the club runs a 2-state [r, ṙ] constant-velocity / white-ACCEL scalar filter
// on the club-head radius, this runs a 3-state [p, v, a] constant-acceleration
// / white-JERK scalar filter — independently on the x and the y pixel
// coordinate of every keypoint (266 scalar filters, x ⊥ y). Read
// clubhead_track.{h,cpp} FIRST: the 3σ Mahalanobis gate, the coast budget, the
// trimTail-before-RTS, the confirmed-run flush and the Off/Pred/Meas tier
// vocabulary are all lifted from it near-verbatim; only the deltas below differ.
//
// Deliberate departures from the club model, each forced by the pose problem:
//   * 3-state (jerk) not 2-state (accel): keypoints accelerate hard through
//     impact, so a constant-velocity model lags the arc. The process noise is
//     white jerk (jerk is the noise term, NOT a stored 4th state) — the standard
//     discrete white-noise-jerk Q, one order up from the club's white-accel Q.
//   * VARIABLE dt per step (REQUIRED): PoseRunner samples non-uniformly (a dense
//     stride near impact, ~4× sparser through the mid-swing, ~100 ms coarse
//     address coverage). F(dt) and Q(dt) are rebuilt every step from the t_us
//     deltas, and each step stores its own dt for the backward RTS pass (the
//     club's dt is a single per-swing constant).
//   * PIXEL domain internally: input kp are normalized 0..1, but W ≠ H makes
//     measurement noise anisotropic in that domain, so we convert IN with (W,H),
//     smooth in px, and emit normalized again.
//   * Segmentation is coast-budget-in-TIME only (coastBudgetMs, not a frame count
//     — the sampling is non-uniform) plus the 3σ gate. There is no θ-jump analogue:
//     nothing external ever re-inits a keypoint, so the gate + the budget ARE the
//     whole segmentation policy (kept intentionally minimal).
//   * Confidence gate: conf < confMeasMin ⇒ that frame offers no measurement and
//     the filter coasts. The classic occluded trail-wrist at the top of the swing
//     becomes a gap that the per-segment RTS bridges — that bridge, rendered like a
//     real measurement, IS the point of the feature.
//
// Not done here (documented residuals — later phases own them):
//   * Hands (leadHand / trailHand / handConf) are copied through UNCHANGED: v1
//     does not smooth the hand centroids.
//   * Derived midpoints (pelvis / neck mids) are NOT computed here — they are a
//     linear combination of already-smoothed parent keypoints downstream, hence
//     equally smooth for free.
//
// Deterministic: same input ⇒ byte-identical output (no clock, no random anywhere),
// exactly like runHeadTemporal. Qt-only (QPointF, via swing_analysis.h) — no
// OpenCV, mirroring swing_analysis.h's cv-free convention. A single pure free
// function; no class, no factory (the segmented KF is a private .cpp helper).

    // averaging matters). Nudged up from the pure ≈42 ms-window value (1e5) for
