// Standalone test for the face-on club-delivery metrics (src/Analysis/club_delivery.{h,cpp}).
// Synthetic shaft tracks only — no fixture, no video, no OpenCV.
//
// THE THREE THINGS THIS TEST EXISTS TO PIN:
//
//   1. PROJECTED HEADS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANGLES, not down-weighted. headPx is only sometimes a
//      measurement; without the Stage-2 head pass it is reconstructed from the grip along the shaft
//      at an assumed length, and its "velocity" is the grip's. §5 builds a track that is entirely
//      projected and asserts NOTHING comes out — because something plausible coming out is the
//      failure mode that would never be noticed.
//   2. THE SIGNS. Past parallel is positive, an upward strike is positive, a low point ahead of the
//      ball is positive — and none of them may invert on a mirrored camera. §4 swings the other way
//      across the frame and asserts the low point keeps its sign.
//   3. THE SUB-FRAME VERTEX. At impact speeds one frame of quantisation is inches of low point, so
//      the parabola refinement is not a nicety; §3 places the true vertex deliberately between two
//      samples and checks it is found there.
//   4. THE TWO CHANNELS ARE SEPARATE AND FAIL SEPARATELY. The angles read the MEASURED heads in
//      samples[]; lowPointAhead reads the SYNTHESIZED arc in synth[] and never looks at a measured
//      head at all. §7 pins that both ways round — an arc with no measured heads still produces a
//      low point, and measured heads with no arc still produce the angles — because the whole point
//      of moving the low point onto the arc was that the head detector goes dark through impact.
//   5. AN ARC THAT NEVER BOTTOMS OUT PRODUCES NOTHING. A vertex on either end of the window means
//      the arc was still descending (or still climbing) when the data ran out, and the "low point"
//      is then just the last sample. §8 pins the refusal.
