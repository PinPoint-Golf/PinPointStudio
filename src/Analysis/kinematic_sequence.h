// Kinematic-sequence reduction — pure, header-only, no Qt-GUI. Given a set of
// speed series (hand / clubhead today; pelvis / thorax / lead-arm when the body-IMU
// roles and the real Sequence producer land), returns the ordered peak-speed events
// with the gaps between them. This is the degrade-gracefully backing for the
// dashboard Sequence zone: it emphasises ORDER and GAPS, not curves, and lights up
// the full proximal→distal chain automatically as more series become available.
//
// Kept out of QML JS by the "reductions live in C++" rule (analysis pipeline guide
// §6.2 / dashboard build prompt §6); the QML façade is ChartMetrics::sequenceNodes.
// Unit-tested standalone in src/Analysis/tests/kinematic_sequence_test.cpp.
