// Pure lead-arm joint-angle extraction from per-segment ANATOMICAL quaternions
// (q_anat = A·q_raw·M; design: docs/implementation/shot_analyzer_m1_wrist.md §4; frame & joint-DOF
// axis tables: docs/design/imu_frame_contract.md §4-5). Header-only and Qt-Gui-only so it is
// unit-testable without the app / SwingWindow.
//
// ANATOMICAL BODY FRAME (from imu_calibration::solveSegment): per segment,
//   +Y = long axis (distal / elbow→wrist),  +X = flexion axis (medio-lateral),
//   +Z = e_x × e_y.  These are SEGMENT-frame axis NAMES.
//
// ⚠ Do NOT conflate those segment-axis names with the axes the wrist DOFs are READ
// ON. The joint angles are extracted from the forearm→hand RELATIVE-rotation matrix
// (see wristFlexExtDeviation below, lines ~117-119), and in THAT decomposition:
// flexion/extension is read about Z, radial/ulnar deviation about X, and axial
// (hand-vs-forearm roll) drops out about Y. The flexion/deviation Z↔X assignment vs.
// the segment-axis names is deliberate and hardware-locked (2026-06; see the SIGN/AXIS
// STATUS note below and line 118) — an earlier "flexion about X" form had the two
// swapped, so do not "restore" it.
//
// SIGN/AXIS STATUS — hardware-locked 2026-06 for the lead (left) arm against
// ~/pinpoint_wrist_log.csv (captured live on the wizard "check your sensors" page). In
// the imu_calibration anatomical frame: flexion/extension = rotation about Z, radial/ulnar
// deviation = rotation about X, forearm pronation = axial twist (Y). The earlier X/Z swap
// is fixed below; signs verified WITHOUT a left/right mirror. NOT yet verified: the
// right-lead (left-handed golfer) case. Known limitation: ~10–15° of FE↔RUD cross-talk
// remains because the no-magnetometer heading (yaw) is unobservable between two sensors
// (see imu_base.h) — primary channels are correct, the secondary leak is the heading work.
//
// CHOSEN CONVENTION (PinPoint = ISB + golf coaching; docs/reference/wristmetrics.md):
//   +flexion  = "bowed"   (lead wrist bowed toward the ground — the impact goal)
//   +deviation= "ulnar"   (toward the little finger — the wrist UN-cocked; the cock/hinge at the
//                          top of the backswing is RADIAL and reads NEGATIVE)
//   +pronation= "roll"    (forearm pronation)
// User-facing names: bow/cup, hinge, roll.

// quaternion double-covers SO(3) — q and −q are the same rotation — so as the physical
// twist passes ±180° the scalar changes sign and this result jumps by exactly 2π. On a
// still frame that is invisible; on a plotted TIME SERIES it draws a vertical cliff, and
// any peak/rate/Δ reduced from the series is then nonsense (a 28,758 °/100 ms "peak rate"
// is the signature).

//
// `anchor` is the index whose value is held canonical — normalised into (−π, π] and then
// unwrapped away from in BOTH directions. For an address-referenced metric pass the
// Address index: `forearmRotation` is defined as travel FROM address and is 0 there by
// construction, and unwrapping from sample 0 instead would leave that defining zero
// sitting at some ±2πk. For an absolute posture pass 0.
//
// ⚠ Correct only while the true angle moves < 180° BETWEEN SAMPLES, which is what makes
// the deltas unambiguous. At the rates these lanes run — ~800 Hz from a wG3, ~200 Hz
// fused — a 2,000 °/s forearm covers 2.5°/sample and 10°/sample respectively, so the
// margin is more than an order of magnitude. A sparse or gapped lane would NOT be safe.
// The single-sample counterpart: fold one angle into (−π, π]. For a caller holding ONE
// instant there are no neighbours and therefore no path to follow, so the principal value
// is the only defensible presentation — a live readout showing −282° for a forearm sitting
// at +78° is reporting the branch, not the wrist.
//
