// flow the SwingLab runner uses, but STREAMING camera frames from disk on demand
// rather than rebuilding a full EventBuffer (which would hold the whole window —
// multi-GB at high FPS — in RAM). Frames are read one at a time into a single
// reusable buffer per camera (raw sidecar offset reads, else cv::VideoCapture);
