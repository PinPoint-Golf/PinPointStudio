// Pose-derived wrist-angle source (WB4, wholebody_pose_design.md §2.2). An
// IWristAngleSource (wrist_assessment_contract.h) that feeds the Wrist assessment
// engine from the SMOOTHED (else raw) COCO-WholeBody pose track when NO IMU-derived
// source is available — the IMU-less lesson mode. It computes APPARENT camera-plane
// wrist angles for the LEAD wrist, NOT anatomical 3D DOFs (§2.2 honesty caveat):
//
//   apparentFlexExt = signed image-plane angle between the forearm vector
//                     (lead elbow → lead wrist) and the hand axis (wrist-root →
//                     middle-MCP).
//   apparentRadUln  = signed image-plane angle between the knuckle line
//                     (index-MCP → pinky-MCP) and the forearm normal.
//
// Because these are PROJECTED, not anatomical, each sample carries reduced
// confidence: min(endpoint conf) × a fixed 0.5 apparent-angle penalty factor
// (PoseWristAngleConfig::apparentPenalty). A left-handed golfer's swing is the
// left↔right image mirror of a right-handed one, so BOTH apparent angles are
// negated for handedness==Left (a whole-image mirror — distinct from the
// engine's per-DOF anatomical mirrorSign, which does NOT apply to camera-plane
// measurements) and the source then reports the canonical right-handed
// convention, exactly as InMemoryWristAngleSource / buildWristAngleSource do.
//
// SHIPS DARK: constructed ONLY when pose.wristAngles.enabled AND the swing has no
// IMU wrist source (wrist_analyzer.cpp). Off ⇒ the object is never built and the
// pipeline output is byte-identical. Qt-only (QPointF via swing_analysis.h),
// cv-free; unit-tested standalone.
