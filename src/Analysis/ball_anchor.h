// v3.4 — the ball as the club's far-end anchor (docs/design/club_tracking_v3_design.md
// §9). An ADDITIVE post-hoc pass applied AFTER decideTrack() returns — reads the
// frozen DP output, fills in individual samples that were NOT already a real
// vision measurement, never re-solves the DP/transition-band machinery. A
// missing or disagreeing ball can only leave the track unchanged, never
// degrade it (design §9.6).
//
// Three exploits (design §9.2-9.4), all gated the same way — "not already
// ShaftMeasured" — so a confirmed measurement is never second-guessed:
//   1. tk0 — the frame the club's measured/tracked theta first departs
//      theta_ball beyond a threshold (the clubhead rotating away from the
//      ball). Computed and logged only (trace.ballTk0Frame) — NOT fed into
//      the phase model/DP; that relabel is v3.0-internal, deferred to the
//      v3.0-r1 corpus re-gate (impl doc's "ACTION" section).
//   3. Impact anchor — the last pre-launch frame's theta, read directly off
//      grip->ball, bridging the impact blur with a measurement instead of a
//      pure kinematic reconstruction.
//   4. Address discrimination + scale floor — publishes ball-anchored theta
//      across the address hold (tk0's domain) where nothing was measured,
//      and derives out.measuredClubLenPx from the grip-to-ball distance.

// Median grip→ball distance (px) over the ADDRESS HOLD PROPER — the swing's own
// per-camera club-length measurement (design §9.4): golfer set, club behind the
// ball, immediately before takeaway, where the straight grip→head shaft ends at
// the ball so |B−G| IS the club length. The window is derived here, not passed:
// the last contiguous quasi-still run of `still` (one char per coverage frame,
// nonzero = quasi-still) that ends at or spans bs0, intersected with
// [0, bs0+collar); null `still` / no such run near bs0 falls back to the
// trailing `collar` frames before bs0. Earlier still periods are deliberately
// excluded — teeing/setup is also quasi-still but with the hands AT the ball
// (tiny |B−G|), and it poisoned the whole-pre-takeaway median 100+ px short on
// the 2026-07-04 corpus. Mis-locks are rejected by a two-pass cluster gate
// (component-wise median ball position over the window, then accept within
// kMaxJumpNormPx of it) — order-independent, so a detector warm-up lock on the
// first frames cannot veto every later good sample the way a first-accepted
// chain gate can. Returns -1 with fewer than kMinLenSamples accepted samples.
// Shared so decideTrack can measure L_px BEFORE head placement (A1) instead of
// the old post-hoc path.
//
// Golf-prior plausibility gate: the cluster gate keeps any CONSISTENT lock, so
// a detector locked onto the driver head at address (gateA-0704: y 130–175 px
// above the truth ball) passed and shorted rung 1. Face-on the ball is always
// between the feet and below the ankle line, so when `ankles` (one entry per
// coverage frame; ok=false where the pose is absent) supplies at least
// kMinLenSamples usable frames inside the window, the pass-1 median ball
// position must sit below the median ankle line (margin 0.02·frameH) and
// inside the ankle x-extent widened 0.1·frameW per side — otherwise the
// measurement abstains (-1; `rejectReason` set 1 = ankle line, 2 = feet
// corridor, 0 = accepted/not gated) and the ladder degrades honestly to rung
// 3. Null / sparse ankles skip the gate (pose-free callers keep working).
