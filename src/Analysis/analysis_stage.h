// Capability-gated stage pipeline over a shared typed context (constrained
// blackboard) — the target orchestration architecture from
// docs/design/analysis_pipeline_fusion_architecture_proposal.md §10. Every future
// fusion proposal (P1–P11) lands as one AnalysisStage with an off-switch instead
// of another branch inside a monolithic analyze(). This header owns only the
// mechanism: the typed context, the stage ABC, the profile, and the dumb
// orchestrator. The per-session stage lists live with their analyzer (wrist
// stages are file-local in wrist_analyzer.cpp until the Swing session needs to
// share them — §10.5 step 4).
//
// Anti-goals (§10.6): no stage registration, no dependency sorting, no
// parallelism. Stages run in authored order; the orchestrator is a loop.
