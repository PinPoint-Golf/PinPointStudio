// Club-delivery metrics a FACE-ON camera can resolve: backswing length, attack angle and low point.
//
// ── Which club numbers a face-on camera can and cannot answer ───────────────
//
// A face-on camera is perpendicular to the target line, so its image plane is (ALONG THE TARGET
// LINE, VERTICAL) and its blind axis is the depth axis, toward and away from the ball. That
// division decides this module's contents exactly:
//
//   IN  — `shaftAngleVsHorizontal` (how far past parallel at the top), `attackAngle` (the vertical
//         angle of the head's velocity) and `lowPointAhead` (where the arc bottoms out along the
//         target line). All three live entirely in the plane the camera sees.
//   OUT — `clubPath` (in-to-out is the depth axis), `swingPlane` (needs the plane's azimuth) and
//         `shaftDirection` (where the shaft points relative to the target line). All three are
//         down-the-line questions and stay planned.
//
// ATTACK ANGLE IS DELIBERATELY IN THIS LIST, and its descriptor used to say the opposite. The
// argument for "down the line makes it fully in-plane" does not survive being written down: a
// down-the-line camera looks ALONG the target line, so the direction the head is travelling at
// impact is its optical axis — the one direction it cannot measure. The vertical angle of a
// velocity that runs along the target line is a face-on reading. The residual error is a cosine
// term from the path's depth component, which is a few degrees of path acting on the tangent, not
// a projection that destroys the quantity.
//
// ── Two channels, on purpose ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The two ANGLES are taken from `ShaftSample2D::headPx`, and `headPx` is NOT always a measurement:
// without the Stage-2 head pass it is projected from the grip along the shaft direction at an
// assumed club length (`ShaftHeadProjected`). A projected head is a rigid function of θ and length,
// so its "velocity" is the grip's velocity plus a length-scaled rotation term — differentiating it
// produces a confident attack angle that contains no information about the clubhead at all. Samples
// carrying `ShaftHeadProjected` are therefore EXCLUDED from the angles, not down-weighted.
//
// `lowPointAhead` DOES NOT USE THAT CHANNEL, and the reason is a corpus fact rather than a
// preference. Across 108 recorded swings the head detector holds a measured lock through roughly
// −45 ms to +40 ms of impact on almost none of them — the club is at its fastest, most motion-
// blurred, and lowest against the turf exactly where this metric is read. Requiring 5 measured
// heads inside ±60 ms of Impact produced a value on 9 of 108 swings, and on the three that could be
// checked the located vertex sat +16 to +38 ms PAST impact: over a metre beyond the ball, which is
// not a low point at all but the lowest of a handful of scattered survivors. The gate was not
// filtering out bad swings, it was admitting bad vertices on the rare swing it fired.
//
// So the low point is read off `ShaftTrack2D::synth` — the kinematically-synthesized arc
// (`shaft_synthesis.h`) Hermite-interpolated between the located P-anchors at a dense fixed
// cadence. On the same corpus that yields a value on every swing with the vertex landing within a
// few ms of impact, and its attack angle at impact is UNBIASED against a launch monitor (+0.02°)
// where the measured-head channel was out by tens of degrees.
//
// ⚠ THIS READS THE SYNTHESIZED TIER, and it is not the first metric to. `shaft_synthesis.h` still
// describes that tier as "excluded from every metric/scoring/estimand"; that sentence stopped being
// true before this metric existed. `kinematic_series.cpp` already prefers `shaft.synth` over
// `shaft.samples` for `clubheadSpeed`, `handSpeed` and `lagAngle` — explicitly, because a C¹ curve
// differentiates better than a gappy one. So the honest statement is that the synthesized arc is
// the input for the metrics that need the club's PATH, and the measured samples are the input for
// everything that needs a per-frame observation. Scoring, the estimands, the plane fit and the
// wrist channel still exclude it.
//
// The coupling that comes with it, for this metric as for the speeds: `synth.enabled=false` takes
// `lowPointAhead` with it. (The speeds survive — they fall back to `samples`; the low point does
// not, because falling back is precisely what produced the vertices tens of ms past the ball.)
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS AN ESTIMATE, published as one. The arc through impact is an interpolation between
// P6, P7 and P8 rather than an observation, so its vertex is pinned near the P7 anchor and what the
// metric really reports is where that anchor puts the head relative to the ball. Measured against a
// launch monitor the spread is ±2.0 in (tuned::clubDelivery::kLowPointSigmaIn) against a corridor
// only 3.2 in wide. That number ships WITH the metric as `MetricSeries::sigma`, and the catalogue
// route is RouteQuality::Estimated so the reading resolves as Bridged rather than Measured. It
// averages well — six swings of one session recovered the device's own session mean to 0.02° — so
// read it as a session tendency and distrust any single swing.
//
// ── Units, and the ruler ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Angles are degrees and need no scale. `lowPointAhead` is signed INCHES, which needs one — the
// ball-diameter px→mm ruler from `ball_position.cpp`, resolved by the caller and passed in. Without
// it the metric is ABSENT rather than emitted in pixels: the invariant-unit rule foot_metrics
// states at length applies here too, because a corridor declares one unit and grading never looks
// at it again.
//
// Pure, deterministic, Qt-only (no OpenCV / no Qt-GUI); unit-tested standalone with no fixture.
