// The face-on swing-plane transition delta (wrist_cock_model.md §9/§13;
// transition_plane_producer_brief.md). THE PLANE IS THE POINT: the shaft vector
// sweeps a circle of fixed radius on the swing plane, and a planar closed curve
// images as an ellipse whose axis ratio is the cosine of the plane's inclination
// to the image plane. So the plane falls straight out of the SHAPE the shaft
// vector traces — no foreshortening model, no per-frame length, no sign
// ambiguity, because a plane fixes which side of the node line every direction
// is on.
//
//     ι     = arccos(minor / major)      larger ι = flatter, smaller = steeper
//     delta = ι_back − ι_down            positive = the club STEEPENED in transition
//
// Two windows off the phase ladder: backswing = takeaway→top, downswing =
// top→impact, both bounds INCLUSIVE (the sample exactly at top is counted in
// both — reference behaviour, and changing it moves the sample counts).
//
// Note what is and is not assumed. head = grip + L·u(θ) algebraically, so the
// path carries no new MEASUREMENT beyond (grip, θ, radius) — but whether the
// resulting 3-D path is PLANAR is a genuine structural claim the algebra does
// not grant, and the conic fit is what tests it. Conflating those two is an
// error; it cost the research a session.
//
// TWO LOAD-BEARING CHOICES, each worth tens of degrees and both learned the
// hard way. They are not tuning knobs:
//
//   · Fit the SHAFT VECTOR (head − grip), never the absolute head path. The
//     absolute path is grip translation PLUS club rotation, so it is not a
//     planar closed curve about a fixed centre and a conic fitted to it is
//     badly conditioned — split-half repeatability degrades from 0.6–0.7° to
//     9.2°, worst case 47.6°.
//   · Normalise ISOTROPICALLY — one shared scale from the pooled radial
//     spread, never per-axis standard deviations. Per-axis scaling is an
//     anisotropic map: it changes an ellipse's axis ratio AND its orientation,
//     i.e. exactly the two quantities being measured. The earlier anisotropic
//     version reported inclinations wrong by up to 40°.
//
// SIGN INVARIANCE. The conic coefficient vector v is defined only up to sign
// (it is a null direction), and this header does not try to match any
// particular solver's choice, because nothing downstream can see it: b²−4ac is
// quadratic in v so the ellipse gate is invariant; M = [[a,b/2],[b/2,c]]
// negates, so its eigenVALUES negate but its eigenVECTOR directions do not; the
// centre solve negates on both sides; `const` negates in step with the
// eigenvalues so −const/ev, hence the axes, the ratio and ι, are invariant; the
// node's mod-180 fold absorbs the eigenvector's 180° flip; and median|D·v| is
// invariant. What is NOT invariant is SCALE — median|D·v| is linear in ‖v‖ — so
// v is unit-normalised before the residual is taken.
//
// Reference implementation: tools/shaftlab/plane_probe.py (`fit_ellipse`,
// `head_path_plane`, `corpus`), which produced the corpus golden file
// docs/research/data/wrist_cock_model/transition_plane_corpus.csv.
//
// Pure header: no Qt, no OpenCV, no tracker types — standalone-testable. The
// caller does the head−grip subtraction and the sample-tier selection, so this
// header never learns what a tracker is.
