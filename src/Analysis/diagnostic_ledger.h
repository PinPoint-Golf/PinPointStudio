// SESSION DIAGNOSTICS ledger — pure, header-only, no Qt-GUI. The maths behind
// PpSessionDiagnosticsPanel: one row per shot per condition, and every tier, recurrence
// caption, trend, link grade, chain and stage the panel draws reduced out of those rows
// and nothing else. Sibling of lm_session_reductions.h and kept out of QML JS by the same
// rule (analysis pipeline guide §6.2): QML positions and paints, C++ decides the numbers.
//
// Per-shot surfaces answer "what happened on that swing". This answers "what keeps
// happening, and what does the authored model think is causing it" — which is a far more
// dangerous question, because a session is fourteen swings and the temptation to say more
// than fourteen swings support is enormous. Most of what follows is that restraint made
// executable.
//
// FOUR RULES DECIDE EVERY NUMBER HERE, and each of them is a decision rather than an
// implementation detail:
//
//   1. NotAssessable is neither clean nor a zero. A measure the capture never took is
//      excluded from EVERY denominator in this file — the recurrence, the Wilson bound,
//      the trend series, the paired 2×2, the resolving window, the focus-split windows.
//      It is still carried, still counted, still drawn (as an outlined tick, never a
//      gap), because "we did not look" is a fact the golfer is owed. The single easiest
//      way to make this panel lie is to let an occluded shaft read as a clean swing.
//   2. The WILSON LOWER BOUND, never the raw proportion. 1-of-2 and 8-of-10 have similar
//      rates and utterly different evidence; the bound is what separates them without a
//      second rule, and it is why the gate can be one number. The bound is an ORDINAL
//      GATE, not a probability claim — nothing in this file publishes it as a percentage,
//      and the recurrence caption is always a COUNT ("8 of 12 measurable shots") because
//      at this n a percentage is a fabricated precision.
//   3. NO EDGE IS EVER INVENTED. The pack's causal DAG is prior knowledge, fixed before
//      a ball is struck; the session only estimates whether an authored mechanism is
//      active in this golfer today. That is also the multiple-comparisons correction —
//      ~140 conditions imply ~10,000 pairs, and testing only the authored edges among
//      this session's pattern-tier conditions is a handful of pre-specified hypotheses
//      instead of a fishing expedition. The corollary is equally load-bearing: a pattern
//      with no authored edge is REPORTED ON ITS OWN LINE, never dropped for not fitting.
//   4. EVERY GATE NUMBER IS INJECTED. LedgerOptions carries the lot, defaulted from the
//      design document's §4 table, so the corpus can tune them without touching a body.
//      There are no bare thresholds below this line.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT and their absence is part of the contract.
//
//   The FAULT PROFILE (prior sessions' prevalence) has no input here at all. It biases
//   ranking and presentation and nothing else, and the way to guarantee that in code is
//   to give the arithmetic no way to see it: identical rows produce identical tiers, full
//   stop. hystereticOrder() is where a ranking bias would legitimately enter, and it
//   cannot reach a tier from there.
//
//   CADENCE (Bandwidth / Every shot / Block / Quiet) does not appear in this file either.
//   Cadence gates SURFACING, never the engine — the ledger accumulates at full rate no
//   matter how quiet the panel is being. A cadence parameter in a reduction is how that
//   rule gets broken by accident, so there is not one to pass.
//
// The QML façade is SessionDiagnosticsModel (src/Gui/session/session_diagnostics_model.h).
// Unit-tested standalone in src/Analysis/tests/diagnostic_ledger_test.cpp.

// to compare. What there is, is the near-total ordering of condition groups by phase —

// An edge whose upstream sits at or before its downstream in that ordering is temporally
// coherent; one running backwards through the swing is not. This is an approximation and
// it is stated as one: it will become exact the day the detector timestamps its findings.
//
// The two caps:
//   · An unentered SCREENED ROOT at either end pins the link at Unanchored. A screened
//     root is confirmed by doing the screen once, and until that happens the chain it
//     would anchor is not anchored (brief §5.4). No amount of downstream co-firing
//     substitutes.
//   · RANGE RESTRICTION caps at Coherent. An upstream firing on every measurable shot has
//     no variance to covary with; a 2×2 with an empty row is not evidence of coupling, it
//     is evidence of a constant. This resolves across sessions as the fault improves,
