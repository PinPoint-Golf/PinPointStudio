// Club-kinematics chart series (clubhead speed, hand speed, lag angle) — three
// per-frame curves the session review chart shows alongside the wrist/shaft metrics.
//
// These are UNSCORED display curves (no reference band, no scorer/trace involvement),
// appended to SwingAnalysis::series exactly like the head/foot detail series. They are
// derived PURELY from the face-on camera products — no IMU input:
//   - clubhead speed = linear speed of the shaft far end (headPx)
//   - hand speed     = linear speed of the shaft grip end (gripPx)
//   - lag angle      = angle between the lead forearm (elbow→wrist pose) and the
//                      clubshaft (grip→head) direction
// Speeds prefer the dense synth shaft channel (ShaftTrack2D.synth) and fall back to the
// measured samples. Hand speed differentiates the grip path; clubhead speed is COMPOSED
// from the track's constituents — |v_grip + L·θ̇·n̂| with the fused club length and the
// sample's own rate (KinematicSeriesInputs::composed) — because differentiating the
// interpolated head path reported the shape of the interpolation near impact. The
// px→metre scale comes from the club-length fusion so the speeds read in mph.
//
// The builder lives here rather than inside the wrist analyzer so every session-type
// profile can reuse it: the Wrist profile appends these via KinematicsStage, and the
// Swing/GRF/Coach analyzers reuse the same camera stages (Pose→Ball→Shaft) to produce
// the shaft/pose products this consumes. When a product is absent (no face-on camera)
// the affected curve is simply omitted — never fabricated.
