// Acoustic shot detector (shot detection P2) — thin QObject around the pure
// OnsetDetector math. A *second consumer* of AudioInputBase::audioDataReady
// (the AudioStreamSaver pattern), running at the device's native rate in
// parallel with STT; adding it never disturbs the STT pipeline.
//
// Owned by TranscriptionController and moved to its audio thread, so
// onAudioData runs as a same-thread direct call: nowMicros() is stamped at
// buffer receipt (small, stable latency — this is what makes audio the
// pinpoint modality) and est_t* is computed before any thread hop.
// impactDetected is emitted on the audio thread; consumers connect with
// their own context object and get the queued hop automatically.
