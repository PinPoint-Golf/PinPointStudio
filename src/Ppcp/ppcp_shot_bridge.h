// The arbitration bridge: this host's detectors nominate, libppcp arbitrates.
// Work package H5.  CORE §8.1, §8.2, §8.4, §8.5f; MSG §7.
//
// ⚠ IT REPLACES `ShotArbiter`, IT DOES NOT WRAP IT, and that is the whole
// design.  `src/Gui/shot/shot_arbiter.h` models THREE FIXED MODALITIES
// (`ArbSource::Acoustic | Imu | Ball | Pose`) in a fixed-width ring, discards every
// candidate on `decide()`, and rejects anything inside a 1500 ms refractory.
// Each of those is an I8 violation the moment a second peer is in the Session:
//
//   - a host microphone and a device microphone are two Sources of the SAME
//     `basis: acoustic`, and a per-modality slot silently keeps one.  CT-I8
//     exists for exactly that failure, and it is silent by construction;
//   - `decide()` throws the losers away, and 5.13d/8.2f require the issued Shot
//     to reference EVERY contributing and excluded Candidate — "exclusion is a
//     conclusion; the Candidate remains evidence";
//   - a refractory drops a nomination rather than retaining it, so a Candidate
//     that arrives late has no Shot AND no record, where 8.2e says it ATTACHES.
//
// Layering the two would give a Session two arbiters disagreeing about which
// Candidates exist.  So `ShotController` asks this class whether it is active
// and, when it is, does not touch `m_arbiter` at all.
//
// ── WHAT `tb:host` IS, EXACTLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `EventBuffer::nowMicros()` and `Ppcp::hostNowNs()` are the SAME `steady_clock`
// reading in different units — microseconds and nanoseconds.  So an
// `estImpactUs` from the acoustic or IMU detector is a reading of `tb:host`
// multiplied by 1000, and nominate() takes nanoseconds because a Candidate's
// instant is nanoseconds.  This is asserted by a test rather than left as a
// comment, because the day one of the two clocks changes is the day every
// arbitrated `t0` is wrong by an unbounded amount with nothing red.
//
// ── I33 / 5.12e — THE CONVERSION HAPPENS HERE AND EXACTLY ONCE ─────────────
//
// The nominator applies §6.1's canonical-instant conversion, because only the
// nominator holds that frame's exposure and the Source's `timing`.  The
// arbiter then applies a TimebaseRelation and nothing else (8.2a).  A host that
// converted again would double the correction — and the error is
// exposure-dependent, so it looks like clock bias rather than like a bug.
// `ppcp_candidate_make_canonical()` is the one function that does it.
//
// ── 8.1b — WHAT IS NEVER A CANDIDATE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The GCQuad writes a two-line CSV rewritten in place, with no trustworthy
// timestamp and a shot counter unrelated to anything of ours.  It has an owning
// peer (us, who observed its arrival) and NO clock relation, which is 8.1's
// middle column: a `ShotLink` with `basis: arrival_pairing`, asserted live by
// the observer.  There is deliberately NO function on this class that takes a
// launch monitor reading and returns a Candidate, and 8.1e is why: a peer must
// not synthesise a Timebase, a TimebaseRelation or an Instant for a record that
// has none in order to route it through nomination.  linkForeignShot() is the
// only entry point, and it cannot produce a Candidate.

    // never recoverable, since `ppcp_arbiter_reconsider()` (8.2d1 / E29) walks
    // only the RETAINED list.  It is recoverable, because a policy-excluded
    // Candidate that creates no group IS retained — libppcp: "An excluded
    // Candidate never CREATES a Shot ... It is retained, and a Shot issued near
    // it later will pick it up."  So the whole remedy is to call reconsider()
