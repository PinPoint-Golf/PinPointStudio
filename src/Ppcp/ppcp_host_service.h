// THE OWNER.  Work package H-compose.
//
// Until this file existed, `docs/ppcp-conformance.md` §7.2 read: "Nothing in
// this application constructs a `PpcpHostPeer`.  H1's transport and H2's peer
// are built and tested; no screen, service or controller starts one."  Three
// joins were named in the code and had no caller, all for the same reason —
// there was nowhere for the link to live.  This is that place, and it is a
// separate translation unit rather than lines in `main.cpp` for a reason that
// cost a day on 22 Aug: `main.cpp` reaches whisper, ONNX Runtime, OpenCV and
// Sparkle, so nothing in `ppcp-tests` can compile it, and a break there is
// invisible until Mark builds the application.  Everything here is covered by
// the `ppcp_app_tu_syntax` row; main.cpp's share is four lines.
//
// WHAT IT OWNS, and why one object owns all of it:
//
//   - the `Listener` (H1) and the accepted link.  RV 5.2g: this host displays
//     the code and therefore LISTENS; the peer that scans dials it.
//   - the `PpcpRendezvous` (H6) whose resolver the listener authenticates
//     against, and which the accepted link's `pairingId` reports back to.
//   - the `PpcpHostPeer` (H2) and the libppcp engine behind it, which in turn
//     own the live Session, the arbitration bridge and the annotation store.
//
// They are one object because they share one lifetime and one failure: a
// pairing that is revoked kills a link, a link that drops leaves a Session that
// 7.5a can reconnect on the same K_tls, and every one of those is a transition
// somebody has to see the whole of.
//
// ⚠ IT OWNS ONE THREAD AND SAYS SO.  `Listener::accept()` blocks, and PPCP's
// pump must run whether or not bytes are arriving (`tick()` is driven by TIME
// PASSING — a link with no traffic still has heartbeats due).  So there is an
// accept thread whose only job is to block on `accept()` and hand the link
// over, and a `QTimer` on the GUI thread that pumps and ticks.  libppcp itself
// remains sans-I/O throughout: ground rule 7 says the embedding supplies the
// thread, and this is the embedding.
