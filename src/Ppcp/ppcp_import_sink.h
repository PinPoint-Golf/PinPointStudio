// What the host DOES with the frames a bundle fed it.  Work package H3.
//
// The transport moves bytes and the engine decodes them; this is the third
// thing, and it is the only one of the three that is PinPointStudio's opinion:
// which of the decoded messages become records on this host's disk.  It reads
// `ppcp_peer_next_event()`, which is the same queue the live socket fills — so
// a Capture that arrived in a file and a Capture that arrived on a wire reach
// this class through one code path and there is no branch in here that could
// tell them apart (plan A10, CORE §9).
//
// ⚠ WHY IT DRAINS AFTER EVERY FRAME.  The engine's event ring is four deep and
// DROPS THE OLDEST when it overflows, and `payload_chunk.data` points into the
// buffer the transport fed — so the bytes of a clip are only valid until the
// next frame is presented.  PpcpBundleTransport calls back per frame for
// exactly this reason.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS NOT HERE.  The imported Session is NOT yet written into the swing
// library as a `swing.json` beside the live captures.  It cannot be: this
// application's `Session.id` is a filesystem directory path and its `Shot.id`
// an `int` ordinal (src/Export/swing_paths.h), and CORE 8.5c keys idempotent
// re-import on OPAQUE ids.  Bolting an opaque PPCP identity onto a path-derived
// one is host work item 2 in the PPS review, and doing it here would either
// duplicate sessions on the second import or throw the PPCP identity away.  So
// the clips and the ledger land under an import root with their real ids, and
// the join to the swing library waits for the identity change rather than
// pre-empting it.
