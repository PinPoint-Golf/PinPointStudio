// The pairing code's clock — work package H6, and the three defects that were
// in it.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL.  `PpcpHostService` had NO test.  It was
// covered by `ppcp_app_tu_syntax` (which only proves it compiles) and by
// `ppcp_conform_host` (which builds the peer, not the service), so every
// behaviour reachable only from QML was asserted by nothing.  The countdown the
// pairing panel displays was one of them, and it had never worked:
//
//   (a) `onTick()` opened with `if (!m_link) return`, so the whole code half —
//       the reap and the countdown — ran ONLY while a phone was already
//       connected.  That is the exact complement of the window in which a code
//       is displayed, so the number a user reads never moved.
//   (b) When a link WAS up, the 20 ms timer emitted `codeChanged` fifty times a
//       second, and a QR view repainting on that signal redrew ~1681 modules
//       each time.
//   (c) Nothing cleared `m_codeLive` at expiry, so the service went on
//       reporting a live code it would in fact refuse to honour (7.3e).
//
// Every test below asserts one of those WITH NO LINK PRESENT, because that is
// the state the bugs lived in and the state a user pairing a phone is in.

// ppcp_arbitration_test (PpcpShotDisposition.*), because this suite's stub link
// has no engine at the far end to decode it.
//

// `<AppData>/ppcp-ledger.json` at construction, and a decline is saved the
