// collapse of the hip span in a face-on image, triangulated from a calibrated camera pair, or
// measured outright by a pelvis IMU — the same number, three methods, three fidelities. Until this
// existed the descriptor could hold only the FLOOR of that ladder, and the rest lived in three
// places that could not be queried and drifted apart: an if/else inside BodyRotationProvider, a
// sentence in the metric's own `description`, and the Capture column of the developer guide.
//
// Now the ladder is data. What follows from that, and is the reason it is worth the manifest churn:
//   * Availability RESOLVES through it — the best satisfied route decides Measured vs Bridged, and
//     the route's own words explain which method produced the number.
//   * The upgrade is derivable — "you are reading this off the face-on camera; a pelvis IMU would
//     measure it directly" needs no second piece of hand-written prose.
//   * "Planned" becomes a fact about a ROUTE, not about a metric. `clubPath` is not work we have
//     failed to do — it needs a camera pointing down the target line. Both statements are now
//     expressible at once, which the single `.planned` flag could not do, and nine metrics were

// PEAK and the Δ over whatever window was selected, and the PEAK RATE. That is right for a curve
// whose every sample is the quantity named — a sway, a speed, a knee angle — and wrong for the
// many metrics a coach reads AT A POSITION or AS A CHANGE BETWEEN TWO. Shaft lean exists only at
// impact (its curve is the shaft swinging through the top, +264° on the 07-04 corpus swing); past
// parallel only at the top; balance at the finish; forward bend as the loss from address to
// impact. For those, a window PEAK is a number about something else, printed under their name.
//
// So each metric says what its card shows, in at most four tiles laid out in this order:
//   readAt  — values of the drawn curve AT these phase instants (label defaults to "@ TOP" etc.)
//   PEAK    — the window's windowed-mean extremum, or over the FIXED span peakFrom→peakTo
//   Δ       — the window's end minus start, or the FIXED deltaFrom→deltaTo change
//   PK RATE — the window's steepest ≥50 ms slope
// Each withheld tile is simply not on the card. THE DEFAULT IS THE OLD CARD EXACTLY: @ IMPACT,
// PEAK, Δ SEGMENT, PK RATE, all window-scoped but the reading.

// APPEND-ONLY (swing.json persists the raw int), so P2/P5/P8 were appended at 12/13/14 long after
// Downswing and Release took 4 and 6. Sorted by value the enum reads
//     P1, takeaway, P4, transition, downswing, P7, release, P10, P3, P6, max speed, P9, P2, P5, P8
// — so a numeric comparison would put P2, P3, P5 and P6 all PAST Impact and exclude every one of
// them from an Address→Impact domain, while P10 (Finish, value 7) would sit inside it.
//
// The sequence below is the one phase_segmenter.cpp assembles and then enforces monotonicity over,
// which is also the chain stated in shot_analyzer_design.md §A.2 rule 5:
//   Address ≤ Takeaway < MidBackswing < Transition ≤ Top < Downswing < Delivery < MaxSpeed
//         ≤ Impact < Release < FollowThrough < Finish
// extended with the three shaft/arm positions that landed after it was written (P2 between the
// takeaway and P3; P5 = ArmParallelDown; P8 = ShaftParallelThrough).
//
// Three placements are judgements rather than readings, so they are stated:
//
//   * TRANSITION SITS BEFORE TOP. phase_segmenter.cpp finds it as the "pelvis axial reversal
//     shortly before Top" — the lower body has changed direction while the club is still going
//     back — and the design's chain says `MidBackswing < Transition ≤ Top`. Coaching language puts
//     "the transition" at the change of direction, which reads as after the top; the measurement
//     does not, and this is the measurement's index.
//
//   * MAXSPEED SITS BETWEEN P6 AND P7. The segmenter searches [Top, Impact + 50 ms] for it, so a
//     late peak CAN land after the strike; but it is the peak of the speed envelope on the way
//     into the ball, the design's chain places it `Delivery < MaxSpeed ≤ Impact`, and a domain
//     ending at Impact that excluded it would refuse a reading taken a few ms before contact.
//
//   * DOWNSWING AND RELEASE ARE THE V1 NAMES FOR THE SAME INSTANTS as ArmParallelDown (P5) and
//     ShaftParallelThrough (P8) — phase_segmenter.cpp says so where it emits one name of each pair
//     and never both. A strict total order cannot give two values one index, so each legacy name
//     follows its P-position immediately. Adjacent is the truth; which side of the tie it falls is
//     arbitrary and nothing may depend on it.
//
// TOTAL AND STRICT: every Phase value has an index and no two share one (metric_catalogue_test
// pins both, and that P1…P10 ascend).
//
// WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY ADDS A PHASE AND FORGETS THIS. The switch has no `default:` label, so a
// compiler warns — but this build does not turn that warning into an error, so the warning alone is
// not a guarantee and must not be described as one. The guarantee is the RETURN VALUE: an unlisted
// phase answers `kPhaseNotInLadder`, and phaseInDomain() then reports it as inside NO domain. That
// converts the failure from silent to loud. Falling through to 0 would have read as Address — index
// 0, which sits inside every domain anybody has authored — so a brand-new phase would have been
// quietly admitted everywhere, which is exactly the class of quiet wrong answer a domain exists to
// stop. Being refused everywhere is wrong too, but it is wrong VISIBLY, at the first authored
// measure that names the new phase.
//

    // THE RULE: A SIGN'S MEANING NEVER CHANGES WITH HANDEDNESS. Whatever transform is needed to
    // hold that fixed is the producer's job, not the reader's. Two frames express it:
    //
    //   WORLD FRAME — referenced to the TARGET LINE, the GROUND and the HORIZON. Positive is to
    //     the RIGHT of the target line, or UPWARD. Nothing is mirrored, because the reference is
    //     the world and the world does not care which way the golfer stands. `clubPath`,
    //     `launchDirection`, `faceAngle`, `attackAngle`, every `lm.*` reading.
    //
    //   ANATOMICAL FRAME — referenced to the golfer's own LEAD side. Positive is extension
    //     (cupping), or rotation toward the target. Producers DO mirror a left-handed golfer, and
    //     that mirror is what keeps the meaning fixed: a bowed lead wrist must read negative for
    //     both golfers, which is the HackMotion convention and the reason
    //     pose_wrist_angle_source.cpp applies an image flip. Removing it would invert every
    //     left-handed swing's archetype.
    //
    // WHAT DOES FLIP IS THE GLOSS, NEVER THE SIGN. "In-to-out", "open", "draw" are right-handed
    // readings of a world-frame number: positive `clubPath` is right of the target line for
    // everyone, which is in-to-out for a right-hander and out-to-in for a left-hander. State the
    // frame-referenced meaning first and the gloss second, or a left-handed reader is misled by
    // prose that looks authoritative.
    //
    // THE CANONICAL STATEMENT IS docs/design/pinpoint_sign_conventions.md — rules 0/1/2 and the
    // per-metric tables. Rule 0 (a published standard outranks a popular product) is why the four
    // ISB joint angles keep ISB polarity even though a market-leading wrist sensor reports the
    // inverse. These fields are that document made checkable at the point of authoring.
    //
    // Both strings are lower-case fragments completing "positive means …" / "negative means …", so
    // they read inside a sentence and inside a table cell.
    //
    // `signPositive` is REQUIRED for anything in a signable unit — every such metric has a
    // direction, even an unsigned one, whose direction is what the magnitude counts.
    // `signNegative` MAY be empty, and empty means "cannot go negative": a carry, a spin rate, a
    // duration. Writing prose there anyway would invent a meaning the metric does not have.
    // metric_catalogue_test enforces both halves, and additionally refuses a world-frame metric
    // stated ONLY as a right-handed gloss — "in-to-out" flips for a left-handed golfer where

    // The geometry: a face-on camera measures `atan2(Δz, Δx_projected)` where the truth is
    // `atan2(Δz, √(Δx² + Δy²))`. Those agree only while the measured segment lies in the frontal
    // plane. A golf swing rotates the body about the vertical axis, so a `Projected` reading taken
    // anywhere past Address is measuring a foreshortened quantity — and the same applies to
    // translations, where turning the pelvis moves the APPARENT hip centre sideways with no sway at
    // all. Only two families escape: readings taken while the golfer is still square, and ratios
    // between two spans at the same depth.
