#include "metric_catalogue.h"

// The one place every descriptor is declared (design §3.3 / build order §3) — the full design
// catalogue (shot_analyzer_design.md §A). 86 descriptors.
//
// EVERY DESCRIPTOR DECLARES A ROUTE LADDER, and it is the only statement of what the metric needs.
// `.routes` is ordered BEST FIRST, and its LAST rung is the cheapest way to get the metric at all;
// both ends are read. The first satisfied live rung decides the shot's answer (Direct → Measured,
// Estimated → Bridged) and the last is what the directory reports as "needs". There is no
// `.requirement` and no `.planned` field any more: a flat requirement could only ever state the
// floor, so the rest of the ladder lived in provider C++ and in prose, and the two drifted.
//
// PRODUCED (45) — metric_extractor ×4, kinematic_series ×3 + shaft-lean, foot_metrics ×5 +
//   ball_position ×1, head_track ×3, lower_body_metrics ×6, upper_body_metrics ×9,
//   body_rotation ×4, club_delivery ×3, the trail-wrist series ×1, tempo_metrics ×2, and the two
//   wrist Summary scores.
//
// DEVICE (26) — the `lm.` readings a connected launch monitor supplies. Live, not planned: the
//   GC Quad connector reads them out of FSX2020's LastShot.CSV. They resolve Measured on a shot the
//   monitor reported and say "needs a launch monitor" otherwise, which is now a true statement with
//   a purchase behind it rather than a promise. See the Launch monitor block at the foot of this
//   file for why every one of them is `lm.`-prefixed even where nothing else could ever produce it.
//
// PLANNED (16) — every rung planned, so nothing produces them by any route. `.planned` on a ROUTE
//   rather than on a metric is the distinction that had been missing, and nine of these were
//   mis-stated because of it: `clubPath` is not work we owe, it is a metric that needs a camera
//   pointing down the target line, and saying "planned" about it promised a pipeline while hiding
//   the hardware. Now both are stated, and if a DTL capture path lands they resolve with no
//   catalogue change beyond dropping `PLANNED` from the rung.
//
//   They group by WHY, which is worth keeping legible because it is what a reader deciding what to
//   build next needs first — and the reason now sits on the route, next to the requirement it
//   explains, rather than in a list somewhere else that had to be kept in step:
//     · DEPTH — the face-on camera's blind axis (pelvisThrust, clubPath, swingPlane, shaftDirection,
//       launchDirection, ballBodyDistance). Requires `dtlCamera`.
//     · SAGITTAL — present in the image, foreshortened to noise by the frontal projection
//       (spineForwardBend, the two knee flexions). The knees keep their face-on rung, Estimated and
//       planned, because it says exactly why nobody reads them there.
//     · NO KEYPOINT — nothing sits between the shoulders and the hips in either pose layout
//       (thoracicFlexion, lumbarExtension), but the back CONTOUR of a DTL silhouette shows both.
//     · SENSORS WE DO NOT PLACE — hipInternalRotation.
//     · WORK WE HAVE NOT DONE — launchAngle / ballSpeed need a ball-FLIGHT tracker (the detector we
//       have is an at-spot presence tracker), kinematicSequence needs angular-SPEED series, and
//       swingScore needs a live adherence scorer. These four KEEP their planned rungs even though a
//       launch monitor now measures the same quantities, because `lm.ballSpeed` is a separate
//       metric and not a substitute — the point of owning the device is to check our estimate
//       against it, which needs both to exist.
//
// NO DESCRIPTOR AND NO PROVIDER MAY READ `sessionType`. Availability is about the shot's data and
//   devices; a session type is what the operator meant to capture, which is not evidence about what
//   was captured. See metric_providers.h.
//
// See the metric-catalogue developer guide for promoting a route to live.
//
// `description` (what it is + why it matters) and `howToRead` (sign, what good looks like, caveats)
// are written as coach-facing narratives for the directory detail page; a route's `summary` is the
// third voice and the shortest — how THIS rung gets the number, named as a method rather than as a
// missing device. The biomechanics, formulae and reference ranges draw on
// docs/design/shot_analyzer_design.md, docs/reference/wristmetrics.md,
// docs/reference/golf_swing_normative_reference.md and docs/reference/swing_json_schema.md.
//
// minTier stays Angles2D on every rung: wrist DOFs come from the fused IMU regardless of camera
// reconstruction tier, and the speed/foot metrics are 2D face-on. Depth is stated as the `dtlCamera`
// DEVICE, not as `minTier = Stereo3D` — three metrics used the tier as a proxy for it, which is a
// pipeline fact standing in for the thing the golfer would actually have to buy, and which no
// directory filter could read.

    // clubheadSpeed, handSpeed, attackAngle, clubPath, launchAngle and ballSpeed. But this ladder
    // resolves exactly ONE winner per key: a Device rung added above `clubheadSpeed`'s camera rung
    // would not sit beside our estimate, it would replace it, and the comparison that justifies
    // owning the device would be gone the moment it was plugged in. So the measurement is a metric
    // of its own and the estimate keeps its bare key untouched. A shot carries both, side by side.
    //
    // WHICH QUANTITIES KEEP A BARE COUNTERPART: those with a non-launch-monitor route in this file,
    // live or planned. `clubheadSpeed` and `attackAngle` we produce today; `ballSpeed`,
    // `launchAngle`, `launchDirection` and `clubPath` are planned optical work we still intend. Each
    // of those six has an `lm.` twin below and the pair IS the validation surface. Everything else
    // here has no bare form at all, because nothing but a device will ever measure it — the nine
    // descriptors that used to carry a PLANNED launchMonitor rung under a bare key were RENAMED
    // rather than promoted, so no key is left behind resolving Unavailable for ever.
    //
    // SIGNS. Foresight states every lateral quantity as POSITIVE-IS-RIGHT for a right-handed golfer,
    // and positive face angle as OPEN. That is self-consistent — face-to-path really is face minus
    // path in its numbers — and it already matches what `faceToPath`, `spinAxis` and
    // `launchDirection` say here. The one place it did NOT match was the old bare `faceAngle`, whose
    // prose said "OPEN IS NEGATIVE AND CLOSED IS POSITIVE" while the metric it feeds said the
    // opposite. `lm.faceAngle` states the device's convention, which resolves that disagreement

    // THIS — the whole section above rests on it, and the catalogue test enforces it in both
    // directions: no reading field may lack a descriptor, and no `lm.` descriptor may exist that no
    // reading field can fill. A quantity we compute has no field to be filled from, so an `lm.` key
    // would fail that check, and rightly: the device did not say this, we did.
    //
    // So it is a bare key with a Device rung. There is no bare-versus-`lm.` pair to worry about
    // here — the pairing rule above exists to stop a device rung REPLACING an optical estimate of
    // the same quantity, and nothing optical will ever estimate this one, because it is made of
    // spin axis and carry.
