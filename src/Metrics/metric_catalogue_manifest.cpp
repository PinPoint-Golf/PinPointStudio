#include "metric_catalogue.h"

// The one place every descriptor is declared (design §3.3 / build order §3) — the full design
// catalogue (shot_analyzer_design.md §A), each metric either LIVE or a PLANNED placeholder.
//
// LIVE (21) — a producer emits it today: metric_extractor ×4, kinematic_series ×3 + shaft-lean,
//   foot_metrics ×5 + ball_position ×1, head_track ×3, tempo_metrics ×2, plus wristScore /
//   wristResemblance (Summary, from a ScoreBreakdown, Wrist session).
// PLANNED (22, `.planned = true`) — in the design catalogue but no producer in this build: the
//   whole-body rotation / spine / pelvis / club-delivery / kinematic-sequence / alignment
//   metrics and swingScore. The PlannedMetricProvider claims these so they resolve "planned", and
//   their `.requirement` reads as "will need …" on the detail page.
//
// See the metric-catalogue developer guide for promoting a placeholder to live (add the producer,
// drop `.planned`, move the key from PlannedMetricProvider to a real provider).
//
// `description` (what it is + why it matters) and `howToRead` (sign, what good looks like, caveats)
// are written as coach-facing narratives for the directory detail page; the biomechanics, formulae
// and reference ranges draw on docs/design/shot_analyzer_design.md, docs/reference/wristmetrics.md,
// docs/reference/golf_swing_normative_reference.md and docs/reference/swing_json_schema.md.
//
// requirement.minTier stays Angles2D for every metric: wrist DOFs come from the fused IMU regardless
// of camera reconstruction tier, and the speed/foot metrics are 2D face-on — gating is by IMU role /
// face-on camera / club track, never by tier. Wrist-Motion-session gating lives in the providers.
