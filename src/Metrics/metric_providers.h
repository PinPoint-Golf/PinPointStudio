// Capability declarations for the three live MetricSeries producers (design §6). Each maps its
// producer's keys to per-shot availability, encoding the session-profile gating the analyzer applies
// (wrist/foot metrics run only in the Wrist Motion profile; kinematics runs in every profile). None
// of these compute anything — production stays in the analysis stages. sessionType == -1 (directory
// browse with no shot loaded) is treated as session-agnostic so "available with my setup" is useful.
