#include "metric_provider.h"

// Capability declarations for the live MetricSeries producers (design §6). None of these compute
// anything — production stays in the analysis stages.
//
// EACH OF THESE IS NOW A CLAIM LIST AND NOTHING ELSE. A provider says "I produce these keys"; HOW
// well, on a given shot, is read off each metric's route ladder in the manifest by the seam's
// default `availability()` (metric_provider.h). Before the ladder existed, every class here also
// rebuilt its metrics' requirements in C++ — a second copy of what the descriptor already said,
// which drifted: `stanceWidthMm` was produced on every ruler-resolved swing and claimed by nobody,
// and `leadHeelLift` was claimed while understating what it needed, so each lied in the opposite
// direction. The requirement now has exactly one home.
//
// Adding an `availability()` override below is therefore a design decision, not a routine step:
// it means the ladder cannot express something, and the first question is whether a route is
// missing from the manifest.
//
// NO PROVIDER LOOKS AT `ShotContext::sessionType`, and none may. Availability answers one question —
// can this shot's data and devices support this metric — and a session type is neither: it is what
// the operator meant to record, not evidence about what was recorded. The gates here therefore
// mirror the stages' own canRun() conditions exactly (a face-on camera, a club track, a ball track,
// a bound IMU role) and nothing else. The field survives on ShotContext because swing.json carries
// it and the resolver's callers pass it through, but reading it here is a defect: an earlier
// `wristSessionOk()` gate made half the catalogue answer "produced in Wrist Motion sessions only",
// which the golfer reads as a statement about their equipment. See appendBodyMetricStages() in
// wrist_analyzer.cpp, which removed the matching gate on the production side.

// A REQUIREMENT THIS SEAM CANNOT EXPRESS: it needs the WholeBody hand keypoints, and MetricRequirement
// has no pose-layout field. Declaring one for a single metric would put a field on every descriptor
// to serve one; the producer refuses a 17-keypoint track outright instead, so the failure is honest

// by a weaker method. That used to be an if/else here. It is now two routes on each of the four
// descriptors, which is what lets the directory show the ladder instead of only its outcome, and

// availability() override: the catalogue answers at the device level (the best rung this shot's

// metrics therefore carry one `Derived` route with an empty requirement, and the claim it makes is
// "the pipeline can produce this", not "this shot's ladder was good enough" — the producer refuses
// an unreliable ladder at analysis time (see tempo_metrics.h).

//   swingScore — the Swing/GRF/Coach adherence score. SwingScorer is dead code and
//     CameraKinematicsAnalyzer returns a stub, so its only route is planned and it always resolves
//     Unavailable. That used to be an `if (key == "swingScore")` here, saying so in a sentence the

// There is no PlannedMetricProvider any more, and reinstating one would be a step backwards. It
// claimed every `.planned` descriptor and answered one fixed sentence, which made it a second list
// of what is unbuilt that had to be kept in step with the first — and drifted, silently, because a
// new placeholder that nobody added to it fell through to "no producer available" (the reason an
// UNKNOWN key gets) rather than to "planned". A metric whose every route is planned now says so
// from its own ladder, in that route's words about why.

// The launch-monitor metrics: face angle and everything downstream of it, spin, strike location,
// carry, and the measured twins of the six quantities we estimate optically. Not a planned
// placeholder — a planned metric has no producer and is a promise; these have a producer the golfer
// may or may not own, so the answer is the ordinary requirement one ("needs a launch monitor"),
// which resolves Measured on any shot the connector reported.
//
// EVERY KEY IS `lm.`-PREFIXED AND THE BARE TWINS ARE NOT CLAIMED HERE. Where we also estimate a
// quantity — clubhead speed, attack angle, and the four planned optical ones — the bare key stays
// with its own producer and the measurement is a metric of its own. The resolver picks one winner
// per key, so claiming both would silently replace the estimate with the measurement, and comparing
// the two is the main reason to own the device at all.

// governed by a rule it states in its own comment — every key `lm.`-prefixed — and these keys are
// deliberately bare: the device did not measure them, it supplied the inputs. Folding them in would
// have made the rule read "every key is `lm.`-prefixed except the ones that are not", which is not
// a rule.
