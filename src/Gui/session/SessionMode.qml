// Session-screen MODE — the layout/activity axis (Capture | Replay | Analyse).
// Effectively global: only one session screen is visible at a time, so a single
// singleton holds the active mode and the focused swing that Replay/Analyse show.
//
// Mode is ORTHOGONAL to the data-source axis (Live vs Loaded, owned by
// SessionReviewController.reviewActive — kept under its legacy "review" name for
// now). Replay/Analyse work on either data-source; only Capture forces Live, so
// entering Capture returns to the live current session. The two compose — do not
// fuse them.
//
// Enum values are plain ints (a QML singleton can't host a Q_ENUM cleanly):
//   capture = 0, replay = 1, analyse = 2. Compare with `=== SessionMode.replay`.
//
// shotReplay (a context property) is reachable from this singleton's root context.
