// One launch monitor schematic and the readings that go with it: a title band, the
// drawing, and a strip of figures under it.
//
// THE CARD'S TYPE DOES NOT SCALE. Every size here is a Theme token, so a card in a narrow
// split and the same card on a bay TV set their labels at the same pixel size as every
// other panel in the app. This is a REVERSAL: the whole graphics view used to multiply one
// fit factor into every coordinate AND every font, which meant the view had no fixed size
// of its own — it read as a different application at either end of the range, and looked
// wrong at both. What scales now is the drawing, and only the drawing.
//
// THE THREE BANDS. Title and strip are fixed; the diagram takes what is left. That is what
// makes "scale the diagram to the frame" true in the plain sense — a taller card is a
// bigger drawing and nothing else moves.
//
// THE READINGS LEFT THE DRAWING, and had to. They used to sit at design coordinates over
// the schematic, which works only while the type shrinks with the geometry it is threaded
// between; with fixed type, a card at half size puts full-size labels over a half-size
// drawing and they collide. In the strip they are laid out rather than positioned, so
// there is no size at which they can overlap the picture or each other. What is lost is
// the label sitting beside the line it names — paid for by the labels staying legible,
// which is the trade the drawing's own reference marks (TARGET LINE, TOE/HEEL) do not have
// to make because they are short, few, and part of the picture.
//
// THE CAPTION MUST NOT WRAP. It states the card's exaggeration ("attack ×4") and a second
// line would eat the drawing's height. It elides instead.
