// Wrist Motion screen (contentStack index 2). Hosts the persistent session
// toolbar, then a View-driven layout: an optional timeline rail, the centre
// stage (camera tiles today; charts/table land later), and an
// optional shot carousel. Which panels show, and how the stage packs them, is
// owned by the toolbar's View control (ViewLayout, per session type). The
// toolbar's device panels run calibration entirely in-panel, so this screen
// neither exposes nor routes any calibrate request.
//
// Replay and Analyse use the Transit timeline, in one of two orientations
// (appSettings.timelineOrientation): HORIZONTAL in the top rail, VERTICAL in a
// fixed-width panel to the LEFT of the stage. Kept in lockstep with
// ScreenSessionMode. Capture has no timeline (RmTimelineChart is resource-monitor only).

    // that way for one build and the column was never once on screen.

    // What it means is therefore "the swing THIS SCREEN has loaded", not "the swing on the screen
    // you are looking at". It empties on its own when the screen genuinely has none — no replay and
