// GRAPHICS MODE for the launch monitor panel — the same shot the tiles board lists,
// drawn instead. Five schematics carrying every metric the device reported except
// distance to pin, which is a fact about the hole and has no line to annotate.
//
// THIS FILE TAKES A MAP, NOT A MODEL. `g` is LmSessionModel's `graphics` property and
// nothing else is wired in. That is deliberate twice over: it keeps the arithmetic on
// the C++ side of the line the whole panel is built on (QML positions and paints), and
// it lets the offscreen layout test feed a literal fixture without standing up a shot
// list — which is what makes "no annotation escapes its card" cheap enough to assert on
// every run, after review caught two of exactly that.
//
// TYPE IS FIXED; ONLY THE DRAWINGS SCALE. This view used to fit a 1148 × 512 design frame
// to whatever room it had and multiply that one factor into every card position, every
// diagram coordinate AND every font size. The result had no size of its own: in a stage
// split the labels shrank below the app's smallest type, on a bay TV they outgrew its
// largest, and neither end looked like the rest of PinPoint. Now the chrome is Theme
// tokens throughout (see PpLmCard) and the composition is a real layout, so what grows
// with the frame is the geometry — which is the only thing on this view that has a reason
// to. Each schematic still scales by coordinate inside PpLmDiagram, into the box the fixed
// chrome leaves it.
//
// ONE CARD PER ROW WHEN SPACE IS SHORT. Below `kMinWideW` × `kMinWideH` the two-row
// composition stops being readable and the cards stack, each full width, each drawing
// therefore LARGER than its slot in the composition was. Both thresholds are in Theme.sp,
// so a golfer running larger type reflows EARLIER — with fixed fonts that is a real
// constraint, and the old scale-based floor could not express it.
//
// WHAT IS EXAGGERATED, AND WHERE IT SAYS SO. Drawn true, a 1.3° start direction and a 3.5°
// attack angle are a pixel of deflection each — a picture that says "straight" about a
// shot that was not. So plan-view and impact-view angles carry a gain, the flight profile
// carries the brief's 2.1× height and 2.5× lateral, and EVERY CARD WITH A GAIN STATES IT
// IN ITS CAPTION. The printed values never move: only the geometry is stretched, and the
// number beside it is always the measurement.
//
// COLOUR IS THE METRIC'S BAND, NOT THE CARD'S. The launch ray inside IMPACT is Launch
// teal; the smash chip inside PATH & FACE is Strike purple. That is what lets a reader
// carry one colour meaning between this view and the tiles board. Lines carry the hue;
// numbers stay colorText2, because a mid-chroma hue on colorSurface is the contrast
// failure the tiles board already had to fix once.
//
// WITH ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS THE ONLY VERDICT ON THIS VIEW: a reading outside its
// corridor is printed in the app's Watch amber or Action red. Nothing else moves — the
// label keeps its band hue, the line keeps its geometry, and a reading inside its corridor
// or with no corridor at all looks exactly as it always did. Every figure goes through
// gradeOf(), and the grade itself is LmSessionModel's; see PpLaunchMonitorPanel's header
// for the three rules that keep this from turning the panel into a dashboard, and
// PpLmSpread for why the ±1 SD regions stay out of it.
