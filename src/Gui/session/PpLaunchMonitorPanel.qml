// The launch monitor session board — every reading the connected device produced this
// session, banded, each tile showing this shot's value, the session mean beside it and
// the session SD as the ±, over a strip that puts the shot against its own spread.
//
// PER SESSION, which is what makes it a stage panel of its own. It answers "what did
// the device measure, and how repeatable was I", and that question is worth asking
// whether or not anything is wrong.
// So the board's DEFAULT STATE IS SILENT: no comparison against our own optical estimates,
// no reassurance, no green, and the only standing colour is band identity.
//
// IT SPEAKS UP FOR EXACTLY ONE THING — a reading outside its corridor. The frame and the
// figure take the app's Watch amber, or its Action red, and nothing else on the tile
// changes. Three rules keep that from becoming grading by the back door:
//
//   · A reading INSIDE its corridor looks exactly like a reading with no corridor at all.
//     There is no Ideal colour and no Good colour, so the board says "this one is out"
//     and never "these others are fine" — which it has no standing to say about a metric
//     nobody has authored a norm for, and there are 18 of those.
//   · The colour and the ±1 SD strip mean DIFFERENT THINGS and are drawn in different
//     channels on purpose. The strip is the golfer against their own other shots — pure
//     geometry, no norm, unchanged — and the corridor is colour. Two shaded regions on one
//     tile would be the version of this that misreads, and neither this board nor the
//     schematics draw one.
//   · Only when the scope has a CLUB. An unknown club boards the whole session and says
//     "all clubs"; corridors are club-shaped, so there the board stays a plain readout.
//
// LmSessionModel resolves all of it — this file paints a string it is handed. See its
// gradesFor().
//
// IT SIZES ITSELF TO THE SCREEN IT IS ON. This board's normal home is a bay TV read
// from across a hitting area, so a fixed tile size is the wrong answer twice over: on
// a large screen it wastes most of the glass and leaves the figures too small to read
// from the mat, and in a narrow split it would clip. Everything — tile, gutter,
// spacing, padding, strip, and every font — is one scale factor `k` away from the
// design's own proportions, and _fitFor() picks the largest k at which the WHOLE board
// still fits. See that function for why the column count is searched rather than
// derived. k never drops below 1: below that the board scrolls instead of shrinking,
// because a value too small to read is not a smaller board, it is a useless one.
//
// THAT IS THE TILES BOARD'S RULE AND ONLY THE TILES BOARD'S. Graphics mode does the
// opposite deliberately — fixed type, scaled drawings — and the two are not inconsistent:
// a tile IS its figure, so growing the tile without growing the figure would leave a big
// card with small writing on it, while a schematic is a picture whose labels are captions
// on it. See PpLmGraphicsBody for the argument on that side.
//
// Every number and every string on it comes from LmSessionModel — this file positions
// and paints and does no arithmetic beyond fitting the grid.
//
// Off by default (ViewLayout.defaultLayout omits it): a golfer with no monitor must
// never be shown an empty board they did not ask for. View → Launch monitor turns it on.
