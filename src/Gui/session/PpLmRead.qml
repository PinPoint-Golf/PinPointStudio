// ONE READING on a launch monitor schematic: a micro label in the metric's band hue over
// the figure in colorText2.
//
// ONE COMPONENT, TWO HOMES. The same block is used at a design anchor inside a diagram
// (where there is room to put it beside the line it describes) and in the card's readings
// strip (where there is not). It has to be one file: two would drift, and the two homes
// are two positions for the same thing, not two things.
//
// THE HUE IS ON THE LABEL, not the figure. It ties the words to the line they describe
// while keeping every number at the contrast the tiles board settled on, after a
// mid-chroma hue on colorSurface failed review once.
//
// WHICH LEAVES THE FIGURE FREE TO SAY ONE OTHER THING, and it says exactly one: that this
// reading is outside its corridor. Band identity is already on the label above it, so the
// two channels never compete for the same glyph — the words stay the metric's colour
// whatever the grade, and the number goes amber or red or stays as it was. Nothing here
// resolves a corridor; `grade` arrives from LmSessionModel with the reading it describes.
//
// FIXED TYPE. Nothing here answers to the diagram's scale — that is the whole point of
// the graphics view's type rule, and it is what makes this block safe to drop into a
// laid-out strip as well as onto a scaled drawing.
