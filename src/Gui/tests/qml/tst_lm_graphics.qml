// The launch monitor panel's graphics body, loaded for real and measured.
//
// THE ASSERTION THAT EARNS THIS FILE: no annotation escapes its card. Every label on the
// five schematics is positioned from its diagram container's top-left in design pixels,
// so a caption that wrapped, a font that grew with fontScale, or a value one character
// longer than the mock's all push a number over the card's edge — and review caught two
// of exactly that before there was a test to catch them. It is checked at the design
// size, at fontScale 1.25, in both themes, and in the reflowed narrow layout.
//
// This loads the REAL PpLmGraphicsBody. It can, because that component takes a plain map
// and no model: the fixture below is the shape LmSessionModel::buildGraphics() produces,
// so nothing here is a stand-in for the thing under test.
