// The session diagnostics panel's body, loaded for real and pressed through its states.
//
// THE ASSERTIONS THAT EARN THIS FILE are the ones about RESTRAINT, because they are the
// ones a screenshot cannot make and a session cannot be made to produce on demand:
//
//   · Cold with an empty fault profile omits the "usually yours" block ENTIRELY. An
//     expectations heading over nothing reads as "the model looked and found none", which
//     is a different claim from "there is no profile yet".
//   · The not-assessable tick EXISTS, is shorter than a firing, and is never a gap. That
//     one is brief §3.1 and §5.2 drawn: a gap in the run reads as "nothing happened on
//     that swing", and the ledger has no such state.
//   · The bandwidth-quiet strip REPLACES the delta strip at the same height rather than
//     collapsing it, so a quiet panel can never be mistaken for a stalled one.
//
// It loads PpSessionDiagnosticsBody rather than PpSessionDiagnosticsPanel deliberately, and
// the split exists for this: the body takes a `source` and owns none of it, so the fixture
// below is the exact shape SessionDiagnosticsModel publishes and nothing here is a stand-in
// for the thing under test. The panel next door is the model, the session directory and the
// ingest connection — none of which a UI test should have to stand up to find out whether a
// tick is the right height.
