// Link stubs for the ReanalysisController seam test. The controller now calls
// into the full offline analysis pipeline (reanalyzeSwingDir) and the swing.json
// writer (writeSwingJson); pulling those in would drag the whole analyzer +
// OpenCV + pose stack into what is deliberately a thin funnel test. The seam
// test only exercises queue/de-dupe/signal behaviour and never reaches the
// worker body (no event loop runs, so QFutureWatcher::finished never fires), so
// trivial definitions satisfy the linker without faking observable behaviour.
