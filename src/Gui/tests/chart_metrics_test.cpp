// ChartMetrics::seriesGroups — the chart's METRICS preset combo.
//
// What is actually at risk here is not the bucketing loop, which is short, but the JOIN: the
// presets are the catalogue's `.group` field, so the manifest and the chart are now coupled, and a
// descriptor that loses its group (or a producer that emits a key the manifest never declared)
// changes what the combo offers without touching a line of chart code. That is the point of the
// design — one grouping vocabulary, not two — and it is the reason it needs a test that reads the
// REAL catalogue rather than a fixture.
//
// So: a synthetic series list, the shipped manifest, and assertions about where keys land.
//
// AND, since Phase 2 of docs/design/metric_presentation_honesty.md, the summary reducers — which
// is now the larger half of this file. ChartMetrics::summaryMasked no longer computes anything
// itself: it marshals the QML bridge's arrays into a src/Analysis/series_reduce.h SeriesView and
// delegates to the four shared reducers the diagnostics engine grades with. What is at risk there
// is therefore not arithmetic in this class but the CONTRACT — which reducer answers which key,
// what happens when one of them cannot answer at all, and whether an invalid sample is really
// absent rather than merely down-weighted. The fixtures below are sized in real TIME (8 ms and
// 27 ms sampling) because every one of those reducers is defined by a time window; the pre-Phase-2
// fixtures were 1 ms apart and shorter end to end than the smallest window in the design.
//
// AND, since Phase 3, the σ-GOVERNED DISPLAY — displayStep, the two formatters' step rounding, and
// the "± x" beside the PEAK and PK RATE tiles. Those are string rules and this is the only place
// they can be asserted at all: the alternative home is a QML binding, which no test can reach. Two
// of the assertions below are load-bearing beyond their own rule. One is that σ = 0 (which is what
// an ABSENT σ becomes at the display boundary, and what most series still carry) reproduces the
// pre-Phase-3 strings byte for byte, because that is what makes the whole phase safe to ship on a
// corpus whose producers have not propagated σ yet. The other is that the step is never finer than
// one unit, because a rule meant to remove false precision must not be able to manufacture it.
//
// AND, since Phase 6, ChartMetrics::windowedMean — the array the chart STROKES. Drawing anything
// other than the persisted samples is only defensible if it is the same reduction the tiles report
// (design §4 principle 1), so what is at risk is an identity rather than a value: PEAK must be an
// extremum of the drawn line inside the window, BIT-EXACTLY, on every fixture in this file. That is
// asserted by scanning the returned array — not by asking the reducer twice — with a checkExactD
// that has no epsilon, because a tolerance would pass exactly the state this design exists to end:
// two implementations of one window, drifting.
