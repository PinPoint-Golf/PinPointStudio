// PpTypePill — what KIND of thing this page is about, beside its title.
//
// The diagnostics library is six views over five kinds of object, and its detail pages hide the
// switcher bar: drill into anything and the page is a big title over stacked sections, which is
// the same shape whether you are looking at a characteristic, a measure or a metric. The reader
// who arrived by following a link two pages back has nothing on screen telling them which.
//
// OUTLINE, not filled, and that is the whole design. The filled capsules under these titles are
// ATTRIBUTES of the thing — its group, its status, its tier — and a sixth filled capsule saying
// "MEASURE" would read as a seventh attribute rather than as the class the other six belong to.
// An outline reads as a frame around the subject, which is what it is.
//
// Deliberately not `PpPill`: the design system reserves that name for the status pill
// (neutral/live/rec/warn/good, with the blinking REC dot), and two components differing only in
// what they mean is how a design system stops being one.
