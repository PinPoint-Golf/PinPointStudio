// TimelineLabels — the single home for all the iterative timeline maths that the
// "no JavaScript logic in QML" rule keeps out of PpTransitTimeline / PpMetricGraph.
// Stateless: every method is const and depends only on its arguments, so one shared
// instance can be declared declaratively (TimelineLabels { id: solver }) and reused.
//
// The 1-D label distribution solver (distribute) is the train-map technique from the
// design mockup: stations sit at their true proportional position on the line; upright
// labels are nudged ALONG the line (the main axis) only as far as needed to clear their
// neighbours, with an elbow connector back to the dot. The same solver serves both
// orientations — horizontal distributes along X, vertical along Y.
