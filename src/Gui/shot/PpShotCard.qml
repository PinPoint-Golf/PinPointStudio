// One shot card in the carousel film-strip. Video still when recorded (or a
// neutral placeholder until real thumbnails arrive), wrist-angle trace
// fallback for IMU-only shots. Overlays: ordinal chip, quality pill, and a
// read-only star row on a bottom scrim. The delegate's required properties
// are auto-filled from the ShotFilterProxyModel roles; the carousel also
// reads them back to feed the review panel, so all roles are declared even
// where this card doesn't render them.
//
// ...and, when a session diagnostics panel is up, one more: a PIP ROW — one pip per tracked
// condition for this swing, plus the count that fired (design 13a, brief §6.1). It is what
// makes the carousel the way INTO the panel post-session rather than a strip of thumbnails
// beside it: the row is that swing's whole diagnostic read at a glance, so a reader picks the
// shot they want to open instead of stepping through them. It costs a null check when no
// panel is up — see the Loader below.
