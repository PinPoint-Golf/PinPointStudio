// PpSessionDiagnosticsWindow — the wall-cast surface for the SESSION DIAGNOSTICS panel.
// A top-level window placed on the secondary display, hosting PpSessionDiagnosticsPanel:
// what keeps happening this session and what the model thinks is causing it.
//
// The target screen, the kiosk map-then-fullscreen dance, the mirror transform, the pin,
// the dwell, the windowed geometry and the viewing-distance scale are all user-kept
// behaviours around the content. No `sessionType`: the diagnostics panel gates on
// available data and devices, never on the session's type, so it has nothing to do
// with one.
//
// TWO MODELS, ON PURPOSE FOR NOW. PpSessionDiagnosticsPanel instantiates its own
// SessionDiagnosticsModel and claims SessionMode.sessionDiagnostics on completion (last wins).
// With an in-app panel AND this cast up there are therefore two models ingesting the same
// shots independently — wasteful, and correct: both are wired to the same ShotProcessor
// signal, both are idempotent per shot id, and both reduce the same rows to the same surface.
// The seam the carousel pips read is simply whichever came up last. Sharing one model between
// the two is a lifetime question (who owns it when the stage panel is torn down and the cast
// is not) that is not worth answering before the wasted CPU is measurable.

    // asked for, and the MAGNITUDE is a user preference and not a constant: a 13" laptop
