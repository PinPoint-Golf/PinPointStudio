class AthleteController;

// ReanalysisController — the single funnel for "re-analyse this shot" from the
// carousel's PpShotActionBar (focused shot) and the set-scope menu ("re-analyse
// all shown"). It reloads each exported swing from disk via the STREAMING
// SwingDiskLoader (no all-frames-in-RAM rebuild), re-runs the production analyzer
// on a worker thread ONE SWING AT A TIME (each runs ViTPose at physical-core
// thread count — sequential bounds memory/CPU), and writes the fresh analysis back
// into swing.json (preserving capture/streams/review).
//
// It is MODEL-AGNOSTIC: callers pass already-resolved swing DIRS (the carousel
// resolves them from its active model — live shotModel or a loaded session's
// review model), and the controller emits reanalysed(swingDir) per success so the
// caller refreshes the right model's row. This avoids the trap of resolving ids
// against the wrong model when a past session is under review.
//
// Registered in main.cpp as the QML context property `reanalysisController`. Kept
// separate from ShotProcessor: that owns the strict live-shot state machine that
// gates `armed`; re-analysis uses its own disk-backed window and never touches the
// live ring, so the two are independent (it may run alongside live capture).
