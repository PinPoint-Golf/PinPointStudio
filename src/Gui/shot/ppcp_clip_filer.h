// PpcpClipFiler — where a phone's swing video becomes part of a swing.
//
// ⛔ THE JOIN THAT WAS DELIBERATELY LEFT OPEN, AND WHY IT CAN BE MADE NOW.
// `clipReady()` was never connected, and the comment saying so was right: a
// PpcpClip carries OPAQUE identities the device mints, this application's swing
// identity is a DERIVED folder name, and writing a clip under the derived one
// throws away the identity CORE 8.5c keys idempotent re-import on.  H3 made the
// same call for imported bundles and refused to bodge it.
//
// What changed is that the ledger now holds both: `SwingRef` on a CaptureRecord
// links the opaque key to the swing without either scheme giving ground (CORE
// 8.5a/8.5b — reconciliation creates links, "no entity is rewritten or merged"),
// and swing.json's `origin` block is the same link written from the other end.
// So this class does not merge the two identities; it records the relation.
//
// ── THE ORDERING PROBLEM THIS EXISTS TO SOLVE ─────────────────────────────
//
// The request goes out at the shot.  The swing folder is allocated 4-11 s later,
// behind the post-roll and the history gather.  The clip may arrive on either
// side of that, and a shot may produce no folder at all.  So:
//
//   · a clip that arrives BEFORE the folder is PARKED, never dropped;
//   · the folder, when it lands, files everything parked for that shot;
//   · a shot that produced no folder discards what it parked, and says so.
//
// ── WHY ONE SHOT AT A TIME IS SOUND ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `ShotController::armed()` includes `!m_processorBusy`, so a second shot is
// refused while the first is in the pipeline — exactly one shot is ever
// in flight.  The correlation is still keyed on the PPCP shot id rather than on
// arrival order, because a clip for shot N can legitimately arrive while shot
// N+1 is being processed, and I27 makes the Capture's own anchor the honest
// answer to "which shot is this".
