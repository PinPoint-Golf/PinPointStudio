// A shot card's diagnostic read, at carousel size: one pip per tracked condition, plus the
// count of the ones that fired (design 13a, brief §6.1).
//
// SAME COLOUR RULE AS THE TICK RUN, AND THE SAME THIRD STATE. Fired fills in the error token,
// clean in the good one, and a condition this capture could not answer is drawn SHORTER AND
// OUTLINED rather than left out — the carousel is where a golfer decides which swing to open,
// and a row that silently dropped the unmeasured conditions would make two different shots
// look like the same read. The panel's PpTickRun makes this argument at the other end of the
// session; this is the same fact at 3 px.
//
// NOT PpPips. The coaching-card pips are sp(6) dots at sp(4) apart, which is a row of eight
// sessions; a swing's read is one pip per tracked condition, seventy-odd on a real ledger, in
// a card Theme.sp(139) wide. So the row keeps the tick run's own marks (a filled bar for a
// firing, a shorter outlined one for a condition the capture could not answer) and shares out
// the width instead, and the fired COUNT in words is the signal colour never has to carry.
//
// EXTRACTED FROM PpShotCard SO IT CAN BE PRESSED. The card requires a dozen model roles and a
// proxy row to exist at all; the pip row requires a list of states. Keeping it separate is
// what lets the offscreen QML test assert the third state is drawn rather than eyeball it,
// and it costs the card one extra item.
