// detectors (IMU impact, acoustic onset, ball launch) call reportCandidate(),
// which funnels through the ShotArbiter's candidate→hold→fuse→commit window
// (shot_arbiter.h). shotDetected is the single signal ShotProcessor
// (post-roll → buffer freeze → shot window → analysis ∥ export → replay) is
// driven from.
//
// On every committed shot a shot-marker event is written into the
// EventBuffer (source "shot_controller", schema "shot_marker_v1") so the
// precise impact instant lives on the same steady_clock-µs timeline as the
// video frames and IMU samples. A later captureSwingWindow() contains the
// marker via entriesFor(), letting the processor align the window to impact.
