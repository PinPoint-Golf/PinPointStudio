    //   - any host detector available → accept only if at least ONE of them

    //
    // "Any one", not "all": ball-launch detection is corroboration-grade by
    // construction (its confidence sits below the local arbiter's lone-candidate
    // floor) and misses often, so requiring it would refuse real shots.  Every
    // available detector's verdict is recorded either way, so the stricter rule
    // can be judged from session data rather than from argument.

    // nothing and the corroboration rule above refuses every Shot it is sent.
    // The rule is then untestable by exactly the automation that most needs to
    // test it.  `PPCP-CONF` §2a already blesses **injected** as a conformance
    // method — "requires the injectable clock, a simulated offset/skew, or a
    // synthetic declaration the implementation would not otherwise meet" — and
    // several CT rows are only reachable that way.  This is that method,

    // ⛔ IT INJECTS EVIDENCE THIS HOST HOLDS, AND NEVER A CANDIDATE ON THE WIRE.
    // A fabricated `candidate` would attribute a detection to a declared
    // microphone Source that heard nothing, which is 8.1e — a peer synthesising
    // a record for something it did not observe.  So this reaches the local
