    // schedules — bandwidth feedback (say something only when performance leaves a
    // tolerance band) and summary/faded knowledge-of-results both beat 100%-frequency

    // the golfer is guided by rather than their own felt sense. Bandwidth is therefore the
    // DEFAULT and the honest one to ship (design §B4).
    //
    // It is nonetheless a setting, because the two modes serve genuinely different
    // sessions: an assessment session, or one with a coach reading the panel over the

    // either mode would be wrong for half its users.
