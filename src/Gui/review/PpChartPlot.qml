// PpChartPlot — one plot region: a Y axis (grid + ticks + unit), an X time axis (ms from
// impact), swing-phase bands + landmark emphasis (top of swing, impact), N metric traces,
// band-coloured P-position dots, a replay playhead, and a shared hover crosshair. Given a series subset (each
// decorated with its `color`), a value range [valueLo,valueHi], a time domain
// [domStartUs,domEndUs], and geometry — so it serves BOTH overlay (one plot, N series) and
// split (N plots, one series each). Pure scale/path binding only; axis maths lives in
// ChartMetrics, phase tags in TimelineLabels. This is the unit future charts reuse.

    // `mean` is THE CURVE THIS PLOT STROKES (design §4 principle 1, Phase 6): the 40 ms centred
    // windowed mean at every sample, from ChartMetrics.windowedMean, which is the same array
    // ChartMetrics.summaryMasked reduces to produce the PEAK tile — so the line and the numbers are
    // one reduction and cannot drift apart. OPTIONAL: a caller that has not decorated it gets the
    // persisted `value` stroked instead, exactly as before this phase (see _meanOf). `meanSigma` is
    // the per-sample standard error of that mean; nothing in here reads it yet — the ±σ ribbon quotes
    // the SERIES' σ, which is a different statement (the instrument's noise, not this window's).
    //
    // `sigma` is the series' 1σ MEASUREMENT noise in its own unit (§5.3) and is read by exactly one
    // thing in here, the ±σ ribbon below. Optional, and ABSENT means never characterised rather
    // than zero — a series without it simply gets no ribbon.
    //
    // The last three are the HONESTY triple (design metric_presentation_honesty.md §5.1) and all
    // three are OPTIONAL, because absence is the common case and must cost nothing:

    //                   BRIDGED across a gated or absent run. Absent/empty ⇒ every sample valid.
    //   `validFromUs` / `validToUs` — the metric's phase domain resolved to INSTANTS by the host
    //                   against this swing's own ladder (PpMetricChart._domainWindow). Absent, or
    //                   a degenerate pair, ⇒ no domain clipping. NOT to be confused with
