// ChartMetrics — the C++ home for the derivation maths that the "no JavaScript logic
// in QML" rule keeps out of PpMetricChart, exactly the TimelineLabels shape. Every method is
// const and depends only on its arguments, so one shared instance can be declared
// declaratively (ChartMetrics { id: metrics }) and reused by every chart.
//
// It is no longer literally stateless: seriesGroups() needs the metric catalogue, so one is
// assembled in the constructor and read-only thereafter (the same "built once, then const"
// shape MetricCatalog uses). No method mutates it, so the reuse property above is unchanged.
//
// Phase names/tags are NOT duplicated here — the chart composes segment labels in QML from
// phaseA/phaseB via TimelineLabels.phaseShortTag, and the crosshair value-at-cursor reuses
// TimelineLabels.valueAtNearest. This class owns only the segment vocabulary and the
// per-window summary statistics; short names are the catalogue's, read through shortLabel().

    // TWO KEYS SAY WHETHER THERE IS ANYTHING TO SHOW, and a display must consult them before it

    // for a slope. Both are the same principle as `partial`'s, one step stronger: partial qualifies
    // a number, these two say there is no number.
    //
    // ⚠ range AND delta DO NOT SHARE EVIDENCE. range = max − min, a span of 40 ms windowed MEANS
    // taken at the samples (ANCHORS) inside the window; delta = end − start, a difference of ±15 ms
    // MEDIANS taken at its two EDGES. Both supports may reach outside the window — neither is
    // clamped to it — so the difference is not the support but what each is anchored on: a window
    // with few anchors in it has little to span while its edges can still have moved. They agree on
    // any window more than a few samples wide, and on a window narrower than the sample spacing
    // they can openly contradict — RANGE 0.2 beside Δ 4, when the edge medians moved and nothing inside the window
    // had a span. That is left as it is on purpose: `range = max(range, |delta|)` would make range a
    // blend of two reducers (so it would no longer be the number the diagnostics engine's Extremum

    // carries and why summary() above can simply pass {}. A mask SHORTER than the curve is
    // discarded wholesale — see the short-mask rule on measuredAt() below, which this shares.
    //
    // An invalid sample is NOT a measurement, so it enters no reduction: it is not in an edge's
    // median window, not in an extremum's 40 ms mean, not in a rate window's fit. The one place
    // this has to reach across a gap is a window edge with no valid sample within ±15 ms of it,
    // and it says so rather than hiding it:
    //
    //   `partial` (bool) — the window's numbers do not rest on a continuous measurement. True
    //   when the window contains an invalid sample, or when an edge fell back to interpolating
    //   between the nearest valid samples because there was none within ±15 ms of it (which is
    //   also the case that catches a window sitting ENTIRELY inside a bridged run, where there is
    //   no sample to scan at all). The card renders it as a "PARTIAL" chip; it never changes a
    //   value.
    //
    //   ⚠ BOTH RULES REQUIRE A HONOURED MASK, so `partial` is unreachable on a series that
    //   declares nothing — exactly as it was before Phase 2. The fallback ALSO fires with no mask,
    //   whenever a window edge lands more than 15 ms from any sample, and on a real timeline that
    //   is ordinary rather than exotic (a fifth of a series' span can be that far from a sample,
    //   with gaps to 80 ms). A coarse series is not an incomplete one: it was measured everywhere
    //   it claims to have been. The chip's claim is "the producer BRIDGED part of this window", and
    //   the mask is the only thing that ever says so; a series with nothing readable at all is
    //   `edgeOk` false, not `partial` true.
    //
    //   `extremumOk` (bool) — false when NO VALID SAMPLE LIES INSIDE [startUs, endUs], so
    //   min/max/peak/range came from the two interpolated EDGES rather than from any measurement in
    //   the window. Ordinary rather than exotic: any window narrower than the sample spacing does it
    //   on a healthy series. It matters more since Phase 6, because the PEAK tile is otherwise a
    //   point on the DRAWN LINE (windowedMean) by construction and this is the one state where it
    //   cannot be — no point of the line is in the window to be the peak. `partial` does not cover
    //   it: that flag needs an honoured mask, so an unmasked series in this state wore no chip at
    //   all. Gate PEAK/MIN/MAX/RANGE on it exactly as PK RATE is gated on `rateOk`; Δ and the
    //   window edges are NOT gated, being statements about instants, which is what the edges are.
    //
    //   `edgeOk` (bool) — false when the series carries NO valid sample: every sample bridged, or
    //   an empty curve. There is then nothing for the window edges to interpolate between, and
    //   start/end/min/max/peak/range/delta are all 0.0 — a "PEAK 0, Δ 0, RANGE 0" card that reads
    //   as a still, well-behaved curve. The tiles print "—" instead, the same way PK RATE does on
    //   `rateOk` false. The zeros are still returned so a caller mid-migration degrades rather
    //   than crashes; a caller that displays them has been told not to.
    //
    // ⚠ THE RATE AND PEAK DEFINITIONS CHANGED IN PHASE 2 (design §5.2), and they changed the
    // numbers on every card, on every swing, whether or not anything is masked:
    //
    //   peak/min/max — was the raw argmax over the in-window samples plus the two interpolated
    //   edges; is now the extremum of the 40 ms centred-window MEAN of the valid samples. A
    //   one-sample outlier can no longer be the peak, because a peak now has to have been there
    //   for 40 ms: one 99 among 4s at 8 ms sampling reports about 23, not 99.
    //
    //   rate — was max |Δvalue/Δt| between consecutive samples, which on a still address is
    //   frame noise divided by 8 ms (39 and 291 units per 100 ms on the corpus, design §7 item 2);
    //   is now the steepest least-squares slope over a window of at least 50 ms carrying at least
    //   3 valid samples. It is SIGNED (a slope has a direction, and no consumer could recover one
    //   this class had thrown away), and it can be ABSENT:
    //
    //   `rateOk` (bool) — false when no window in [startUs, endUs] qualifies (a window shorter
    //   than 50 ms, or fewer than 3 valid samples in it, e.g. a two-sample series). `rate`,
    //   `rateSigma` and `tRateUs` are then 0 and MUST NOT be displayed: the card prints "—" and
    //   hides the per-100 ms unit with it. A fabricated 0 would read as a still, well-behaved
    //   curve, which is the exact class of confident absurdity this design exists to remove.
    //
    // `peakSigma` / `rateSigma` are the σ of the winning window, for the "± σ" the summary card
    // carries beside those two tiles — design §5.3. Both are the NOISE, never the motion:
    // peakSigma is the standard error of the window's mean about a LOCAL STRAIGHT LINE through it

    // design §4 principle 1 forbids. Phases 1–3 left the drawn line alone deliberately: the stroke
    // passed through every persisted sample, and only the STROKE said which of it was measured. The
    // cost was that the eye and the card were reading different things — the tile said PEAK 23
    // because a peak has to hold for 40 ms, while the line beside it visibly touched 99, and a
    // reader can only conclude that one of the two is lying. Phase 6 closes that by drawing THE
    // CANDIDATE MEANS reduceExtremum ranks (series_reduce.h windowedMeans): the same per-sample
    // centred 40 ms mean, the same ≥3-sample symmetric widening, the same exclusion of invalid
    // samples. So `summaryMasked().peak` IS an extremum of this array inside the window, bit-exact
    // and by construction rather than by agreement — which is what chart_metrics_test pins on every
    // fixture — and the drawn line is a REDUCTION with a definition, not a display filter with a
    // taste.
    //
    // ⚠ AND IT IS NOT A SMOOTHER, in the one sense that matters: nothing here changes what is
    // persisted (design §6 — no `value` moves in 5.1–5.3), and the raw samples stay ON SCREEN as
    // faint dots behind the line (PpChartPlot.showRawDots, default on). A reader can always see the
    // wobble the reduction is refusing to call a peak. There is no OTHER smoothing anywhere in the
    // chart: this one shared reduction or nothing.
    //
    // An INVALID sample's entry is its RAW value, not a mean, and that is deliberate: it is not a
    // measurement, it is drawn dashed, and it may not draw on its valid neighbours (nor they on it).
    // So a caller can draw `mean` for the WHOLE curve and the bridged runs still show the persisted
    // values, exactly as they did before this phase. `ok` is NOT exported — the QML side already
    // decides validity per sample (PpChartPlot._measured, the same short-mask rule), and a second
    // copy of that verdict crossing the bridge is a second chance to disagree with it.
    //
    // `sigma[i]` is the standard error of that mean about a local straight line — the same number
    // `peakSigma` carries for the winning window (never the spread of the samples; see
    // series_reduce.h detail::windowMeanSigma). It is 0 where the reduction has nothing to say, and
    // meaningless on an invalid entry (a raw value has no window), which costs nothing because the
    // ±σ ribbon draws over measured runs only.
    //

    // the curve is a malformed document and is discarded wholesale.

    // MethodCloned; QQmlPropertyData::isCloned() carries it into the QML property cache), so
    // `cm.formatValue(v, unit)` binds to a distinct 2-argument entry rather than resolving an
    // overload set — the thing that is fragile. Verified against shipping call sites in this Qt
    // 6.11.1 build, deliberately at BOTH arities, because a clone being reachable says nothing about
    // the full form still being reachable beside it:
    //   · SHORT form  — PpDetectCluster.qml:145 `shotController.triggerShot()`, none of its two

    //                   one of two.

    // everything else spaced); EMPTY means no token, which is what the two tiles want because the

    // ── READINGS ARE QUANTISED, UNCERTAINTIES ARE QUOTED ────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // The rule, and the one line to remember: displayStep governs READINGS. It has no business
    // touching a ±. An uncertainty is not a reading of the athlete taken at some precision, it is
    // the statement of how far the reading can be trusted, and it is only ever read AGAINST the
    // value beside it — so it is QUOTED at a fixed one decimal and never quantised:
    //   · one decimal, always ("± 2.4", "± 12.4");
    //   · "± <0.1" below 0.05, which is also where an exactly-zero `err` goes;
    //   · never "± 0.0", and never "± 0".
    //
    // Three concrete things went wrong when the step DID govern this, all found in review:
    //   · PK RATE — a fitted-slope standard error of 3.0 printed "± 5" on a series whose σ chose a
    //     5-unit step, inflating the stated uncertainty by two thirds for a reason belonging to
    //     another quantity entirely (the σ is in the metric's unit; a slope's error is per 100 ms).
    //   · PEAK — peakSigma is about σ/√k for a k-sample window, so it is SMALLER than σ by
    //     construction and a step chosen from σ rounded it to nothing on essentially every card;
    //     the "fall back to one decimal" branch was the only one that ever ran, and a rule whose
    //     main branch is unreachable is a rule that is not doing what it says.
    //   · THE σ CHIP — the plumb bob's own σ is 0.03–0.06 in, so quantising it printed "± 0.0in",
    //     which claims exactness in the one place on the card whose entire job is to deny it.
    // Quoting removes all three at once, and removes the discontinuity with them: an err of 2.4 and
    // an err of 2.6 now print "± 2.4" and "± 2.6" instead of jumping "± 0" → "± 5" across half a
    // step. There is no `sigma` parameter, deliberately — not an ignored one, an absent one, so a
    // future caller cannot reintroduce the coupling by passing it.
