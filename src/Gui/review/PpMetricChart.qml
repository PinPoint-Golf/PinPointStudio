// PpMetricChart — reusable, prop-driven metric chart. Toggles between a single overlaid
// plot (all series, shared Y) and small multiples (one PpChartPlot per series, each Y
// auto-scaled). Owns the chart-LOCAL view window [viewStartUs,viewEndUs] (it never touches
// shotReplay / SwingDataSource, so different chart instances scope independently). The
// playhead and the view window are conceptually distinct — the window never moves the
// playhead; the playhead is simply clipped when outside the window.
//
// Phase 1: split/overlay, axes, phase bands, traces, P-dots, playhead, hover crosshair +
// tooltip, legend chips. Phase 2 adds the segment brush + chips → viewStartUs/viewEndUs.
// Phase 3 adds the summary cards. Phase 4 adds the METRICS preset combo — which catalogue
// group of series to plot, since a full capture now produces far more curves than one panel
// can show. Heavy maths lives in ChartMetrics; phase tags/value lookup in TimelineLabels;
// colours/sizes/fonts in Theme.
//
// TWO independent narrowings, deliberately kept apart: the preset chooses WHICH SERIES
// (enabledKeys), the segment chips/brush choose WHICH TIME SPAN (viewStartUs/viewEndUs).
//
// ⚠ WHAT THE LINE IS, since Phase 6 of docs/design/metric_presentation_honesty.md. Every surface
// here draws and quotes the 40 ms centred WINDOWED MEAN — the array ChartMetrics.windowedMean
// returns and ChartMetrics.summaryMasked reduces for the PEAK tile — decorated onto each series
// entry as `mean` in _plottable, ONCE per data change. The raw samples remain on screen as faint
// dots behind the stroke (PpChartPlot.showRawDots) and the hover row prints the raw value beside
// the reading, so nothing is hidden and nothing persisted is touched. This is the ONLY reduction
// applied to a drawn curve anywhere in this panel: display-only smoothing is forbidden outright
// (design §4 principle 1), and the way to stay honest about a windowed line is to make it the same
// window the numbers come from.

    // to a summary card (design §5.1).
    //
    // ⚠ A SIDE THE MANIFEST DID NOT NARROW IS NOT CLIPPED AT ALL. The default domain is
    // Address..Finish, but this chart's AXIS is the PADDED swing (Segmentation swingStart/End

    // .seriesSigma, one implementation in C++ where it can be tested, replacing the three copies of
    // a four-clause guard that had grown here, in PpChartSummary and inside PpChartPlot._sigmaRuns.
    //
    // ⚠ BUT IT IS NEVER CALLED FROM A PER-FRAME BINDING, and that is why the two functions below
    // TAKE the σ instead of deriving it. seriesSigma's argument is a QVariantMap, so every call
    // marshals the whole series (t_us, value, valid, phaseSamples) across the QML boundary — the
    // same cost measuredAt() carries its own warning about. The hover tooltip re-evaluates on every
    // cursor move and the facet gutter on every frame of a brush drag; both would pay it per frame
    // per series. So each σ is resolved ONCE on a binding that changes with the DATA (the tooltip
    // row's `sig`, the legend chip's `sig`, the plot delegate's `facetSigma`) and passed down.

    // ── THE SPLIT-MODE GUTTER'S "@end" — THE DRAWN LINE, AT THE WINDOW'S LAST SAMPLE ──────
    //
    // ⚠ IT WAS A ±15 ms MEDIAN AND IT IS NOW THE MEAN (F6b), and the choice is deliberate rather
    // than incidental. summaryMasked's `end` is reduceAt — the median of the valid samples within
    // ±15 ms of the window edge — which made this the THIRD reduction on a panel whose whole claim
    // after Phase 6 is that it shows one. On a facet 40px tall, beside a trace drawn as the windowed
    // mean, a number from a different reducer is a number a reader cannot check against anything in
    // front of them. So it reads the same array the trace strokes, at the last sample in the window.
    //
    // WHAT IS GIVEN UP: a median at an INSTANT becomes a mean at a SAMPLE, so on a coarse series the
    // reading can be up to half a frame's motion from the window edge the brush is sitting on. That
    // is the crosshair's convention too (PpChartPlot's per-series markers snap to the nearest sample),
    // and being consistent with the line beside it matters more here than being exact about an
    // instant nothing is drawn at.
    //
    // NO RAW COUNTERPART IN THE GUTTER, unlike @IMPACT's tooltip: this is a 40px column with no hover
    // surface of its own, and PpChartPlot deliberately imports no Controls (a ToolTip there would pull
    // the whole module into the hottest component on the panel). The plot's own hover row already
    // prints the mean and the raw sample together at ANY instant, including this one.
    //
    // ⚠ AND IT NO LONGER MARSHALS ANYTHING (F6b). This binding re-evaluates on every frame of a brush
