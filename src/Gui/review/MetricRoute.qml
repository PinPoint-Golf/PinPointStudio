// MetricRoute — the one-line router that links a metric ANYWHERE in the app to its
// catalogue detail page. A dashboard tile is instantiated several layers inside a
// stage delegate (and again inside a top-level cast Window), so it has no path to
// the settings screen that hosts MetricLibrary/MetricDetail. Rather than thread a
// signal up through every host, tiles call MetricRoute.open(key) and Main.qml — the
// one place that owns navigation — performs the jump.
//
// Deliberately state-light: `requestedKey` is a record of the last request for a
// late-attaching listener, not a queue. The signal is the contract.

import QtQuick

QtObject {
    // Last requested metric key ("" = none requested yet).
    property string requestedKey: ""

    // Emitted on every open() — including a repeat of the same key, which is a real
    // user action (they clicked it again) and must still navigate.
