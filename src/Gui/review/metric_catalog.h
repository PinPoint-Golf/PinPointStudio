// MetricCatalog — the QML façade over pinpoint::analysis::MetricCatalogue (design §7), the same
// shape as ChartMetrics / SwingDataSource: a QML_ELEMENT declared `MetricCatalog { id: mc }` whose
// only job is to marshal registry value types into QVariant shapes. The catalogue is assembled once
// in the constructor (makeMetricCatalogue) and read-only thereafter.
//
// A `shotCtx` QVariantMap parameterises per-shot availability + normative resolution. Shape (all
// optional): { tier:int, sessionType:int, imuRoles:[roleName…], hasFaceOn, hasDtl, hasClubTrack,
// hasBallTrack, archetype, club, shape }. Omit it (or pass {}) for the context-free directory view;
// pass a shot's capability (or the studio's configured capability) to drive availability chips.
// Phases are emitted as Phase ints (the vocabulary QML already compares and TimelineLabels renders).
