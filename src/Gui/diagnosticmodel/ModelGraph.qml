// The graph pane. It SWAPS the middle pane and keeps the rail and the inspector, so switching views
// keeps your place — selection is shared with the table.
//
// EVERY coordinate comes from ModelBrowser.graph(), which is dag_layout.h. QML positions nothing:
// rank assignment, ordering, routing and overlap are the only things about this surface that can be
// tested, and a layout computed inside delegate bindings is a layout nothing can assert. What this
// file does is draw, hit-test and drag.
//
// ── Editing: the gesture is the permission ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// There is NO editing mode and no editing toggle. A structural edit begins with a deliberate
// press-and-hold on the thing you mean, which opens the ring (RingMenu.qml). A mode would make
// permission a place you are standing rather than something you did: it has to be found, remembered
// and turned off, it is invisible at the moment of the accident it exists to prevent, and it forces
// affordance chrome onto every node for ever to advertise a state. 350 ms of pressure is a stronger
// consent signal than a switch flipped twenty minutes ago, and it cannot be left on.
//
// The price is that structural editing has no resting affordance here at all. It is paid three ways,
// and all three are load-bearing rather than nice: right-click opens the SAME ring (every desktop
// author tries it); the first hold of a session holds its labels a beat longer; and the inspector
// keeps every verb this ring has, worded identically, so an author who never discovers the ring
// loses no capability whatsoever.
//
// ── One input layer, not a handler per item ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every press on this canvas arrives at ONE MouseArea, which hit-tests the point itself. It cannot
// be a handler per node: the ring has to open on a link and on bare canvas too, and per-item
// handlers fight each other for the grab during exactly the held drag this whole surface is made
// of. So the nodes and the edge labels are drawn items with no input of their own, and everything
// below decides what a press meant.
