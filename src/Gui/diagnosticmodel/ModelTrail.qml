// The trail: the chain you actually walked to get here. Its terminal item is ALWAYS the current
// selection, which is what makes it a trail rather than a history — a metric, the measure that
// reads it, the corridor that judges it, the characteristic that fires, read left to right.
//
// Clicking a step goes back to it and truncates everything after, so the trail never carries a
// future you have left.
//
// It is reset, not extended, whenever the author picks a row out of the table — see selectFresh() in
// DiagnosticModel.qml. Only a followed RELATIONSHIP is a step; choosing where to stand is the start of
// a different chain, and a breadcrumb that kept the old one would be describing a route nobody took.
//
// It is also the middle pane's HEADING (ADDENDUM-02, A2). It used to be a pill on the global toolbar
// labelled TRAIL, one band above a separate row that named the type — a breadcrumb and a pane title
// saying overlapping things in two places. Drawn as a heading, the terminal item IS the title, and
// with nothing walked yet it degrades to `fallbackLabel`, which is exactly what that second row said.
// So the pill, the eyebrow and the band all go, and nothing is lost.
