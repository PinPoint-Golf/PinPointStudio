// The press-and-hold ring. ONE component for every selection type — a node, a link, a multi-select
// and bare canvas differ only by the array passed in, never by a subclass, because the whole promise
// of the shape is that the silhouette is identical every time it opens.
//
// ── The eight slots are fixed by MEANING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Clockwise from north the ring reads look · make · set · unmake, and a direction means the same
// thing whatever is selected. `model` is therefore EXACTLY EIGHT entries, index 0 = N and rising
// clockwise, with `null` for a slot this selection does not fill. A gap is a hairline, never a
// greyed-out button and never a live spoke moved up to close it: muscle memory has to survive a
// change of selection, so the only variable between one opening and the next is how many wedges are
// lit. `enabled: false` is treated as a gap for the same reason — there is no disabled state here.
//
// Each entry: { icon, label, hint, kind, enabled, danger, values[] }
//   kind    "action"  commits on release
//           "drag"    commits by handing off to a drag with the button still down (§5)
//           "value"   carries `▸` and opens the collar
//   hint    the spoken label — what the hub says while this spoke is hot, and the ONLY place the
//           ring explains itself. It is why the wedge itself can stay icon-plus-short-label.

// the time the ring exists. The canvas feeds track()/release() instead. A latched ring — the
