// ModelBrowser — the whole Diagnostic Model panel's model: one connected content graph, read and
// edited through one object.
//
// ── Reuse; do not reimplement ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The brief's rule, obeyed where it counts: every RULE here is a call into the layer that owns it —
// causesOf/effectsOf/coverageOf/hasCausalPath and tailsOfAxis (characteristic_pack.h), validatePack,
// diagnosticsHealth, layoutDag, measureDisplayLabel, the shared screen/drill/reference registries,
// and the enum label tables. What is reimplemented is MARSHALLING, and only marshalling.
//
// It replaced an earlier façade that read the pack AS SAVED, which is correct for a read-only panel
// and fatal for this one. Editing here accumulates in an unsaved WORKING COPY of the user pack (rule
// 8: "Save is once, not per field"), and every surface has to show the library as it would be if you
// saved now — the table, the inspector, the graph, and above all the validation strip, which is
// worthless if it grades the file rather than the draft.
//
// ── The layering ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   m_core        the shipped pack, read-only, and the ONLY way to answer "does this ship?"
//   m_savedUser   the user pack as it is on disk — the baseline every dirty mark is measured from
//   m_working     the user pack as edited. Unsaved.
//   m_assembled   core + memory(m_working). Rebuilt after every mutation; everything reads this.
//
// The NORM set is layered identically — m_savedNorms / m_workingNorms / m_norms — because corridors
// are edited here too, and ONE undo history spans both registries. A command therefore snapshots
// both packs, and one Save writes both files. Two histories was the alternative and it was rejected
// as too complex to reason about: an author who edits a characteristic, then its corridor, then hits
// ⌘Z twice has one mental model of what should happen, not two.
//
// Copy-on-write falls out of the layering rather than being coded: editing a field of a SHIPPED
// object copies that object into m_working, and undoing that first edit removes the copy — which is
// exactly the reset, with no separate "take theirs" path to keep in step. That is ADDENDUM-01's
// third point, satisfied structurally.
//
// ── QML holds no rules ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Sorting, filtering, faceting, search, legality of a proposed link, which cell may be edited and
// with what control, and which of two values is "yours" — all decided here. QML is handed columns()
// and rows() and renders them; it does not know what a Measure is. A rule written in a delegate is
// a rule nothing can test.
