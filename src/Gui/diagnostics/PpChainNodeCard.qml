// ONE NODE ON THE CHAIN RAIL, in whichever of the four things a node can be.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT PpPatternCard IN A COMPACT MODE. It was written that way first and the
// two cards turned out to share four fields out of nine. A chain node publishes `mark`,
// `phase` and `measure` and publishes NO `fresh`, NO `directionText`, NO `recencyText` and
// NO `trendText`; a Forming card publishes exactly the opposite set. Reusing the Forming
// card would have meant a phase·measure line it has no data for, three tags bound to
// undefined, and — the part that decided it — a `kind` switch inside a file whose whole job
// is to draw the ONE kind the Forming row has. Three of the four kinds here are not cards at
// all: a ghost is an outline with a name, a screened root is a call to action, an outcome is
// the miss the golfer declared. They belong together because they are alternatives to each
// other, and they do not belong inside the card that has none of them.
//
// THE FOUR MARKS ARE THE HONESTY DEVICE and they are the model's words, never composed here
// (brief §4, §5.4). A screened root is drawn as a REQUEST — attention-tinted, with the screen
// that would settle it — and never as a finding, because until the screen is entered it is
// not one. A ghost is dashed and dimmed for the same reason the Cold expectations are: it is
// not evidence from this session. Neither ever borrows the live card's surface.
