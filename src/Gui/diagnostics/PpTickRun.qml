// The evidence run: one tick per shot in the ledger, in the order they were struck.
//
// THE NOT-ASSESSABLE TICK IS THE WHOLE POINT OF DRAWING IT AS A RUN RATHER THAN A COUNT.
// A shot whose measure did not exist is neither clean nor a zero, and the design's answer
// is a SHORT OUTLINED tick — present, obviously different, never a gap. A gap would read as
// "nothing happened on that swing", which is the one thing the panel must not say (brief
// §3.1, §5.2). So there is no branch in here that skips a tick, and there is no width at
// which one disappears: a ledger longer than the card narrows the pitch until it fits.
//
// THE SELECTED TICK IS THE REVIEW PANEL'S ONLY POSITIONAL DEVICE (brief §6). Reviewing a
// finished session, every count on the panel is a session total and the ONE thing that says
// which swing is being read is this tick: 6 px wide against 2.5, 14 px tall against 11, and
// outlined in colorText so it survives being drawn over a fired fill. It is deliberately not
// a colour change — the tick's colour already means fired/clean/not-assessable, and a
// selection that recoloured it would overwrite the fact it is pointing at. The model decides
// WHICH tick is selected (ticksFor() carries `selected`), because a delegate comparing shot
// ids would have to know the panel's selection to draw a run.
//
// Every tick's state comes from SessionDiagnosticsModel::ticksFor(). This file positions
// and paints.
