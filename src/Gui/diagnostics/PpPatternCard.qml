// One pattern, as the session has it so far. Brief §4.2, top to bottom: name, the fresh
// tag, the state pill for THIS shot, the recurrence count, direction-or-dispersion, the
// run of ticks, trend + recency, one line of evidence prose.
//
// EVERY STRING IS THE MODEL'S. `recurrence` is a count over assessable shots and never a
// percentage; `directionText` is either the direction claim or the sentence saying why the
// claim is withheld, and this file cannot tell which and does not need to. The one thing
// decided here is which of the two lines gets dropped when the card is short — the evidence
// prose, per 12c ("cards lose their evidence sentence") — because that is a fact about the
// space, not about the evidence.

    // condition's causes and effects with; two verbs cannot share one hit target, so the six
    // characters that already said "FOCUS ▸" became the focus target and the card became the
    // drill-in. That is a reassignment of an existing affordance rather than a new one, and it
    // wants a design pass with the rest of the drill-in. What has ALSO not been designed is the
    // moment AFTER declaring: the split point is invisible on the run (the ticks before and after
