// THE QML FAÇADE for PpSessionDiagnosticsPanel — the one object between a recorded swing and
// the panel that says what keeps happening.
//
// It is a JOIN and an ORCHESTRATOR, and deliberately not a second place where diagnostics
// arithmetic lives. Everything it publishes is one of three things:
//
//   · a reduction from `src/Analysis/diagnostic_ledger.h` (every tier, recurrence, trend,
//     link grade, chain, stage, bookend and anti-churn ordering),
//   · a fact from the authored pack (`src/Diagnostics`: names, consequences, screens,
//     causal edges, the explanation pass), or
//   · a STRING assembled from the two, here, because "QML positions and paints, C++ decides
//     the numbers" (analysis pipeline guide §6.2) means the panel gets sentences and not
//     ingredients. There is no arithmetic in this file that diagnostic_ledger.h could have
//     done, and no wording in the QML that this file could have written.
//
// INSTANTIATED BY THE PANEL, not registered in main.cpp as a context property — the same
// decision LmSessionModel documents and for the same reason, sharpened. The session
// diagnostics panel is OFF by default (the user turns it on in View), and this model owns a
// characteristic pack, a norm provider and a worker thread that re-runs detection on every
// shot. A golfer who never opens the panel should not be paying for any of it, and a model
// that reached for the singletons itself would additionally be untestable — which matters
// more here than anywhere, because the thing under test is a claim about a golfer.
//
// ── The five decisions worth knowing before reading the .cpp ────────────────────────────
//
// 1. THREADING. ingestShot() returns immediately. Detection reads swing.json, which is up to
//    tens of megabytes, and doing that on the GUI thread would stall the app in the ten
//    seconds between balls — exactly the moment the panel exists to serve. Work runs on a
//    private single-thread QThreadPool (one thread, so shots reduce in the order they were
//    struck) and the finished ShotRecord is delivered back by a QUEUED invocation, so every
//    mutation of the row vector and every signal emission happens on the thread that owns
//    this object. setSynchronous(true) collapses that to an inline call for tests, and is
//    the only concession the design makes to being tested.
//
// 2. WHAT IS PERSISTED. diagnostics.json holds the ROWS and the intent, never the verdicts —
//    diagnostic_ledger.h's serialisation contract, unchanged, wrapped in a thin envelope
//    (schema tag, session meta, focus contract, declared miss, screen answers, which shots
//    carried launch-monitor data). Review mode re-reduces and gets the identical panel by
//    construction, and a gate that moves in a later build re-grades an old session honestly
//    rather than quoting a stale verdict. Written atomically after every ingest, so a crash
//    mid-session costs at most the shot in flight, and activateSession() reconciles what is
//    on disk against the swing_* directories beside it and back-fills the difference —
//    which is also what makes the panel safe to enable half way through a session.
//
// 3. WHAT THE FAULT PROFILE MAY TOUCH. `fault_profile.json` lives in the ATHLETE folder (the
//    session directory's parent) and is read at activation and written at close. It reaches
//    exactly two things: the Cold state's `expectations` list, and the `score` fed to
//    hystereticOrder(). It is structurally incapable of reaching a tier, a corridor or a
//    firing, because the only function that reads it — profileBias() — is called from
//    rankScores() and from nowhere else, and LedgerOptions has no field it could be poured
//    into. That is brief §5.5 made a property of the call graph rather than a promise.
//
// 4. WHEN explain() RUNS. Over the PATTERN-TIER set only, and only when that set's
//    membership changes (design §A5) — per-shot re-ranking would churn the resolver's greedy
//    set cover on every ball and reorder the footer under the golfer's eyes. The footer is
//    then debounced a second time, by kDiagDriverDebounceShots, so it appears only once the
//    pattern set has held still: better absent than flickering (§B8).
//
// 5. WHAT CADENCE GATES. `quiet` and `afterShotDelta`. Nothing else, ever. ingestShot() does
//    not consult it, the ledger does not see it, and the persisted rows are byte-identical
//    under both modes — brief §5.6. A cadence check anywhere near the ingest path is the
//    single most likely way for this panel to start lying, so there is exactly one place in
//    the .cpp where m_cadence is read and it is named surfaceThisShot().
//
// The panel comes in a later phase; every property below is already the finished shape it
// will bind to. Unit-tested standalone in
// src/Diagnostics/tests/session_diagnostics_model_test.cpp.
