// The reviewed shot, read INSIDE the finished ledger (design 13a, brief §6).
//
// IT REPLACES THE AFTER-SHOT STRIP AND THE BOOKENDS, AND IT SHOWS EVERY CONDITION. The live
// strip reports a moment and is subject to cadence; this one reports a shot the golfer went
// looking for, so nothing is withheld and no cadence gate is consulted — a reader who picked
// shot 9 is owed all nine reads, not the two the panel would have volunteered at the time.
// That is why the cells WRAP rather than being counted-and-truncated the way the pattern card
// row is: a condition the reader asked about is not allowed to be a "+3 more".
//
// IT IS A BAND, NOT A PAGE. The mock's strip is two rows of nine cells at the top of the panel,
// and the panel underneath it is the point of the panel. A real capture answers thirty-odd
// conditions, most of them with the same two words twice — "not measurable" beside "clean all
// session" — and drawn in pack order they take five rows and four fifths of a 560 px frame to
// say that nothing happened. So the model SORTS by information (fired here, clean here, silent
// here but a pattern or a watch this session) and MARKS the silent tail, this file bounds the
// grid to the mock's two rows and scrolls inside it, and the tail collapses behind one dashed
// line that expands IN PLACE into the same cells (§8: nothing withheld, one tap away). Nothing
// is dropped and nothing is summarised away — the tail's line names both silences, and opening
// it is one press.
//
// THE POPULATION IS ONE. The headline counts fired against fired+clean ("7 of 9 conditions
// fired on this swing") and the not-assessable measures are stated SEPARATELY underneath,
// because folding them into the denominator would quietly turn "we did not look" into
// "it was fine".
//
// NEITHER SLOT IS EVER BLANK ON A NOT-ASSESSABLE CELL. The value reads "not measurable" and
// the corridor slot carries THE REASON — "shaft occluded at P6", "ball not tracked". A blank
// there reads as a bug in the app rather than as a limit of the capture, and the dashed border
// is the same distinction drawn a second way. Both strings come from the model; this file
// positions and paints.
