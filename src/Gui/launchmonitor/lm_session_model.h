// unique_ptr to an incomplete type has to be destroyed where the type is complete. Same
// shape as MetricCatalog, the other QML façade that resolves a corridor.

// The launch monitor session board's model (PpLaunchMonitorPanel).
//
// Every number is lmSessionStats()' — this class only decides WHICH SHOTS it is asked
// about, and turns the answer into rows. Instantiated by the panel rather than living
// in main.cpp as a context property, because the panel is off by default: a golfer with
// no monitor should not be paying for a model that recomputes on every shot.
//
// ONE ROW PER BAND, not per field, which is where this departs from the brief's shape.
// The board is banded — a gutter rule, a name, a count, then that band's tiles — and a
// flat field-per-row model cannot express that without either a proxy per band or
// DelegateModel groups populated from JS. A band row carrying its own tiles is the same
// data in the shape the thing being drawn actually has, and it keeps ONE projection of
// the statistics rather than two that can disagree.
//
// WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM, and why not the obvious place. ShotListModel's
// MetricsRole looks like the right input — it is a map keyed by exactly these metric
// keys — but its values are DISPLAY STRINGS, and SwingDocReader rounds every degree
// metric to a whole degree on the way in. Fifteen of the twenty-five reading fields are
// in degrees, so a standard deviation computed from that map would not be a suppressed
// statistic, it would be a wrong one printed confidently. AnalysisDetailRole's `series`
// carries the raw doubles the writer put there, and it is populated by the same code
// path for a live shot (updateLaunchMonitor → refreshShot) and a reloaded one
// (readSwingJson), so there is one source here and not two.
//
// AND THE ONE JUDGEMENT IT DOES MAKE: whether the focused shot's reading sits outside its
// corridor. Every tile and every annotation carries a `grade` — "ideal" | "good" | "watch"
// | "action", or empty — resolved through the norm set at the scope's own club context.
// The panel paints only the last two, so a reading inside its corridor still looks exactly
// as it did: no green, no reassurance, and no colour on a metric nobody has authored a
// norm for. That is the point of resolving it here rather than compiling a table — 7 of
// the 25 reading measures carry a norm today, the rest say nothing rather than guessing,
// and authoring one in the model browser lights its tile with no change to this file.
//
// IT DOES NOT LIVE IN lm_session_reductions.h AND MUST NOT MOVE THERE. That header is a
// READOUT — the golfer against their own other shots, no norm and no grade — and it stays
// one. The join to the norm set is a projection for a surface to paint, which is this
// class's job, and it is why the dispersion strip and the corridor cannot be confused:
// the strip is geometry the reductions computed, the corridor is colour resolved here.
