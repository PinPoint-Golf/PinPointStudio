// Settings -> Phones.  Where a remembered PPCP pairing is seen and revoked.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS A CONFORMANCE SURFACE AND NOT A CONVENIENCE.  RV 7.4b: persistence
// is "visible to the user, and individually revocable", and both of those are
// this panel — its whole reason to exist.  A remembered pairing is a standing
// ability to complete a handshake with this host, so it is shown rather than
// kept out of the way.  It used to be a table at the foot of the home screen;
// deleting that table without providing this would have been a regression
// against 7.4b, which is why the two changes are one commit.
//
// ⚠ THERE IS NO "REMEMBER" BUTTON HERE, AND THAT IS NOT AN OMISSION.  7.4b's
// third clause — persistence is opt-in — was itself downgraded to a SHOULD by
// libppcp erratum E57 (25 August 2026): a user who has just paired a device
// has already given the consent a separate opt-in step used to ask for twice,
// so `PpcpRendezvous` now remembers a pairing the moment it completes.  What
// this panel offers instead is the opt-OUT — "Forget" — which is what 7.4b's
// surviving clauses actually require: visible, and individually revocable.
//
// ⚠ IT USED TO CARRY A WARNING FOR WINDOWS AND LINUX, AND NO LONGER NEEDS ONE.
// makePlatformPairingStore() returned a keychain store on macOS and NULL
// everywhere else, so persist() refused and no phone was remembered across a
// launch at all — an empty list on such a machine would have read as "you have
// never paired one", which is a different and untrue statement, so it was said
// out loud.  libppcp erratum E56 (25 August 2026) made RV 7.2c a SHOULD and the
// PRK moved into the app's own settings on EVERY platform, so the condition the
// banner described no longer exists and the banner has gone with it.
//
// Rows come from `ppcpHost.phones` — the SAME list the home screen's DEVICES
// section and the resource monitor draw from, because a paired phone is a
// device and there should be one answer to what phones this host knows about.
// What is extra here is the pair of controls 7.4b requires.
//
// ⚠ REBUILT 25 Aug 2026 TO MATCH CamerasPanel.qml / ImusPanel.qml.  A phone is
// a device the same way a camera or an IMU is one, so its row wears the same
// frame: a status dot, an editable alias, a connection indicator and a strip
// of read-only facts.  The alias is new — `PpcpHostService::setPhoneAlias()`
// — and sits beside `cameraAlias`/`imuAlias` in the settings file rather than
// through `AppSettings`, since `Ppcp` has no dependency on `Gui/app` and this
// keeps it that way.  There is deliberately no expandable "test" panel the way
// IMUs have one: a phone has no host-driven live view to show, and a fake one
// would be worse than none.  What IS deliberately here, empty of content for
// now, is room for more: the facts strip and the row's structure both exist so
// a future preference (a placement, a rate, anything RT-20/RV-6 add) has a
// slot to land in without another redesign.
