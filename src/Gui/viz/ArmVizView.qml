// ArmVizView — rigid Y-bot arm segments driven by IMU quaternions.
//
// Each arm (upper arm / forearm / hand) is extracted from ybot.glb as a
// standalone bone-local GLB.  Bone-local means the joint sits at the segment's
// origin, so rotating a Node around that origin produces the correct pivot.
//
// Kinematic chain (per arm):
//   armNode  (positioned at shoulder joint)
//     └─ arm segment Model
//     └─ elbowNode  (at Qt.vector3d(0, 0.274, 0) in arm-local space)
//          └─ forearm segment Model
//          └─ wristNode  (at Qt.vector3d(0, 0.2761, 0) in forearm-local space)
//               └─ hand segment Model
//
// Rotation math (all quaternions world-space from IMUs):
//   armNode.rotation     = armRestQuat * imuUpperArm
//   elbowNode.rotation   = imuUpperArm.inv * imuForearm
//   wristNode.rotation   = imuForearm.inv  * imuHand
//
// IMU mounts (placement roles, AppSettings::imuRoles — design §4.13):
//   leadForearm  → forearm near the wrist — the calibrated IMU
//   leadHand     → back of the hand
//   leadUpperArm → upper arm (optional)
//
// Instances are resolved by ROLE, not by position in imuManager.instances,
// because instances() iterates a QMap in device-ID order.

// Handedness — derived from athleteController.currentHandedness:

    // Witmotion one — never the owning peripheral, which is what quatApplyCalib()
    // below actually reads (quatW/X/Y/Z, anatCalibrated, anatQuat, calibrated,
    // calibTransform all live on the unit, not the device).

    // A HackMotion unit IS anatomically framed, and this view needs nothing added to drive one.
    // HmInstance's display tick sets anatQuat from hm_frame::toAnatomical() with the selected
    // candidate whenever the device reports itself calibrated (src/IMU/hm_instance.h, the
    // anatCalibrated/anatQuat pair), so an HmUnit answers quatApplyCalib() exactly as an

    // pronation on distinct axes.

    // "the arm is hanging at the side". The gap is ~90° of ELEVATION, and it is why a coach who
    // calibrated and then held the pose saw an arm hanging by its side that nonetheless tracked
    // every movement correctly.
    //
    // ⚠ MEASURED, IN THREE INDEPENDENT WAYS, because this project has been bitten three times by
    // frames reasoned out from prose:
    //   - the three Phase D captures: streamed q_arm returns to within 1.3-7.9° of identity, and
    //     sits 26-35° off it right after the 0x94 — pose 1's ~30° raise. So identity is pose 0.
    //   - on hardware: calibrate, hold the pose, and the avatar hangs the arm down.
    //   - the constant below reproduces BodyVizView's own guide geometry exactly — pose 0 lands on
    //     bone direction (∓1, 0, 0), "straight across the body", and pose 0 → pose 1 measures
    //     30.00° against hmCalRaiseDeg's 30.
    //
    // Derived from the SAME quaternions the guide is posed with — BodyVizView's hmCalUpperArmQuat
    // and hmCalForeArmPose0Quat through the pre-baked parent chain in body_pose_adapter.cpp:53-56
