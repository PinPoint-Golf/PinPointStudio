    // ── Device-native (HackMotion) calibration guide poses ────────────────────
    // The wG3 computes its own calibration ON-DEVICE from a two-pose routine
    // (libwrist specification.md §8.2), performed as ONE CONTINUOUS motion
    // because the device watches the whole travel rather than sampling two static
    // poses:
    //
    //   pose 0  upper arm hanging at the side but FLEXED FORWARD, elbow bent, the
    //           forearm horizontal and STRAIGHT ACROSS the body, palm DOWN
    //   pose 1  the forearm ELEVATED hmCalRaiseDeg, THE ELBOW STAYING PUT
    //
    // ⚠ THE RAISE MOVES THE FOREARM NODE, NOT THE UPPER ARM, and that is the whole
    // reason this file animates the forearm override at all. "Elbow in the same
    // position" fixes the upper arm: the elbow sits at the end of the upper-arm
    // bone, so ANY upper-arm rotation other than one about its own long axis moves
    // it. The upper-arm quaternion is therefore IDENTICAL in both poses and only
    // leadForeArmOverrideRotation changes — which is why _leadForeArmFrom/_To and
    // the forearm's own onChanged handler exist further down. ⚠ Without that
    // handler this guide would not animate AT ALL: the existing trigger is a change
    // in the upper-arm override, and here there isn't one.
    //
    // ⚠ WHY THE UPPER ARM IS FLEXED FORWARD, AND WHY THE FOREARM IS NOT. A forearm
    // held straight across a body whose upper arm hangs vertically passes THROUGH
    // the torso — the elbow sits at z ≈ -0.06, behind the belly's front surface.
    // Two ways out, and only one of them is the routine: tilt the FOREARM forward
    // (it then reads as pointing out diagonally, which is not "across the body"), or
    // flex the UPPER ARM forward so the elbow comes out in front and the forearm can
    // lie flat across the chest. The second is what a person actually does, so it is
    // what the guide does. hmCalUpperArmFwdDeg is the amount.
    //
    // ── DERIVATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // Built with the SAME composition the pose adapter already uses, rather than a
    // fresh one: body_pose_adapter.cpp:41-63 pre-bakes the constant parent chain
    // from this file's own rest quaternions, and body_pose_adapter.cpp:216 sets a
    // forearm from  m_tLeftForeArm = lArmW.conjugated() * faW  — i.e.
    //
    //       forearm_local = conj(upperArm_world) ⊗ forearm_world
    //
    // with  upperArm_world = spineRest ⊗ spine2Rest ⊗ shoulderRest ⊗ upperArm_local.
    // That chain reproduces the live node hierarchy's own sceneRotation to 1e-6, so
    // the constants here and the running scene agree.
    //
    // The upper arm is the hanging-down rotation pre-rotated in WORLD space about
    // +X by -hmCalUpperArmFwdDeg, which carries the bone from (0,-1,0) toward +Z
    // (forward) while leaving its roll relationship intact; the local quaternion is
    // then conj(parent) ⊗ that. forearm_world is the frame whose columns are the
    // bone's own axes: +Y the bone direction, -Z the DORSAL face (the side
    // OrientationTab marks and the wG3 sits on), +X = Y × Z. Pose 0 wants bone +Y
    // straight across the body — exactly (-1,0,0) for a left lead arm, no forward
    // component — with dorsal +Y (up), which is palm DOWN. Pose 1 rotates both by
    // hmCalRaiseDeg in the vertical plane containing the bone, so the palm stays
    // down relative to the forearm through the whole travel.
    //
    // ⚠ Checked against the live chain, not by eye. Shoulder at (0.188, 1.436,
    // -0.062); the flexed upper arm puts the elbow at (0.182, 1.226, 0.114) — in
    // FRONT of the torso. Pose 0's wrist is (-0.094, 1.226, 0.114): identical y and
    // z to the elbow, so the forearm is exactly horizontal and exactly across, and
    // it crosses the midline by 0.094. Pose 1 lifts the wrist to (-0.057, 1.364,
    // 0.114) — elbow unmoved, z unmoved, bone direction exactly hmCalRaiseDeg
    // higher, dorsal marker still above the palmar one.
    //
    // ⚠ 30° IS THE ROUTINE, NOT A MINIMUM. §8.2 separated a full ~30° travel
    // cleanly in the 0x94 payload (28.9° palm / 30.9° arm) and could not separate
