// Role → sensor, across two unrelated concrete types

//
// ImuManager::instanceForRole() owns the placement rule — a bare device id keys a
// Witmotion, HmUnit::unitId() ("<deviceId>#lowerArm" / "#palm") keys a HackMotion,
// and one wG3 fills leadForearm and leadHand — and hands back the object the viz layer binds
// to. That object is an ImuInstance for a Witmotion and an HmUnit for a
// HackMotion.
//
// ⚠ AN HmUnit IS NOT AN ImuInstance AND NEVER WILL BE. HmInstance is a PEER of
// ImuInstance rather than a subclass (hm_instance.h:184-194), and HmUnit is a child
// QObject that merely duck-types the same property NAMES so ImuVizView/ArmVizView
// resolve them through the metaobject. So the `qobject_cast<ImuInstance *>` this
// helper used to end with silently returns nullptr for a HackMotion slot — which
// this readout would display as "no sensor assigned" rather than as the assigned
// sensor it could not describe. Both kinds are therefore cast for explicitly.
//
// Deliberately NOT a shared base class or an interface header: the duck-typing is
// the design (imu_device.h sets out why the device-agnostic base carries only what
// ImuManager calls generically), and hoisting anatomical accessors into it is a
// bigger refactor than this phase authorises.

    // anatomical convention with ours, and HmInstance's display tick sets anatQuat from
    // hm_frame::toAnatomical() with the selected candidate whenever the device reports itself
    // calibrated. So a calibrated wG3 produces a lead-wrist readout here exactly as a Witmotion
    // pair does, and this wrapper needs nothing but the two accessors it already forwards.
    //
    // ⚠ Throughout Phase C this said a HackMotion was uncalibrated here and the "—" was the
    // honest outcome. That was true then and became false the day Phase D shipped, which is worth
    // remembering: a comment pinned to a phase is a claim with an expiry date on it.
    //
    // The "—" is still what an UNCALIBRATED unit yields, and that is still deliberate. Do not
    // "fix" it by feeding the raw quaternion through, and do not invent a transform: the wrist
    // angle 2·acos|q_a·q_b| is convention-blind, so a wrong frame yields a perfectly plausible
