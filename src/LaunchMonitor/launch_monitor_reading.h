// WHY EVERY KEY IS `lm.`-PREFIXED. The monitor's first purpose here is to be a
// REFERENCE INSTRUMENT we check our own optical estimates against, not a better
// producer of them. The route ladder resolves exactly one winner per metric key,
// so a device rung placed above the camera rung on `clubheadSpeed` would not sit
// beside our estimate — it would replace it, and the comparison that justifies
// owning the device at all would be gone. So the measured value is a metric of
// its own (`lm.clubheadSpeed`) and the estimate keeps its bare key untouched.
// The prefix is applied uniformly, including to quantities we will never
// estimate (`lm.faceAngle`), so a reader never has to remember which is which.
