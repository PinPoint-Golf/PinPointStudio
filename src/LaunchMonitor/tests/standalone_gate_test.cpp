// This decision has behaved differently on a real machine than it did on paper TWICE —
// once because it did not require capture to be active at all, and once because the whole
// path sat behind a setting that was off, so a tester saw silence and concluded nothing
// had been delivered. Both were reasoning errors that no amount of care in the controller
// would have caught, because the controller is where the facts are GATHERED and this is
// where they are JUDGED. Hence a pure function, and hence this file.
//
// The rescue path is deliberately absent from here: a shot the app detected but could not
// record needs no permission beyond storage being on.
