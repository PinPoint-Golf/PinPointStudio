// be active at all, and once because the whole path sat behind a setting that was off. A
// decision with that history should be exhaustively testable without standing up a
// CameraManager, so the controller's remaining job is to GATHER facts, which is the part
// that is hard to get wrong.
//
// The rescue path — a shot the app detected but could not record — deliberately does NOT
// come through here. It needs no permission: the app saw a shot and the device measured
// it, so there is nothing left to be cautious about.
