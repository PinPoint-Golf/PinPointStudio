// LOAD-TIME ERRORS — the file cannot be read as this build understands packs:
//   parse                the bytes are not JSON, or not a JSON object
//   schemaTooNew         the pack declares a schema version above kPackSchemaVersion. Refused
//                        outright rather than partially read — see the constant above
//   noPackId             a pack with no id at all. Nothing can namespace it, nothing can layer it,
//                        and every issue it raises would be attributed to the empty string
//   unknownKind          a MEASURE declares a kind that is not composed or provided
//   unknownSignalTest    a signal declares a test that is not one of the four
//   unknownDetection     a condition declares a signal-combining mode that is not any, all or first.
//                        An ERROR rather than a fall back to `any`, because "all" misread as "any"
//                        turns one conjunction into N faults that each fire on their own
//   unknownShape         a measure declares a shape that is not target/floor/ceiling. An error
//                        rather than a fall back to Target: "flooor" would grade the good tail
//   unknownDirection     a measure's unwatchedTail is not high or low — same reasoning
//   unknownConditionKind a condition declares a kind that is not one of the seven. A misread kind
//                        lands the row in Fault, where the kind rules then accuse it of the wrong
//                        defect entirely

//   unknownGroup · unknownObservability · unknownConfirmedBy · unknownState · unknownViewNeeded ·
//   unknownStatus        the same rule for the six fields that used to fall back silently. Each

//                        rules reason about it, whether a corridor can ever be graded — so a typo
//                        produced a row that loaded, rendered and validated clean against the wrong
//                        answer
//
// ONE REGIME across all of those: an ABSENT key still means the documented default, and only a
// token that is present and unrecognised is refused.
//
// STRUCTURAL ERRORS — the pack parsed, and is broken:
//   duplicateId          two entities share an id
//   unknownMeasure       a signal references a measure that does not exist
//   unknownSignal        a condition's detectedBy names a signal that does not exist
//   unknownCondition     an edge endpoint does not exist
//   cycle                the condition graph is not a DAG
//   selfEdge             an edge from a condition to itself
//   signalArity          wrong measure count for the test (2 for order/ratio, 1 otherwise)
//   signalDirection      a corridor/threshold/ratio signal with no direction — it cannot identify a
//                        tail, and a ratio has two of them like anything else
//   signalThreshold      an authored number on a test that inherits one, or none on a test that has
//                        nothing to inherit from (threshold and ratio — a quotient keys no norm)
//   signalRatioUnit      a ratio whose two measures are not in one unit, or do not state it. The
//                        quotient is then not a pure number and the authored figure is in a unit
//                        the model cannot name
//   corroboratesCausal   Corroborates between conditions that already have a causal path. The pair
//                        would double-count in the confidence ranking; one relationship or the other
//   axisMismatch         two tails share an axis id but not a series — then they are not tails
//   badFacets            a measure's series fails the validity table
//   badReducer           a measure's reducer is malformed
//   measureOutsideDomain a LIVE measure reads its metric outside the phase domain where that
//                        metric's geometry means anything (MetricDescriptor::domain). Only
//                        raised when the caller supplied a MetricDomainFn, because the domain
//                        lives in the metric catalogue and this file cannot see it
//   unwatchedTailShaped  a one-sided measure claiming a tail is "deliberately unwatched". The shape
//                        already says which tail does not grade; the two cannot both be true
//   unwatchedTailWatched a measure claiming a tail is unwatched that a corridor signal watches
//
// WARNINGS — the pack works, but the health list should show it:
//   observableNoSignal   an Observable and Measured condition nothing can detect. Scoped to
//                        Measured: Screened/Asserted conditions are signal-less by design
//   noCause              a condition with no cause: it can be reported but never explained
//   noResolvableCause    every cause is Asserted, so the resolver can offer but never conclude
//   orphanCause          a Latent condition that explains nothing — dead weight
//   unusedMeasure        a measure no signal uses
//   proposedTier         no citation; the UI must badge it
//   needsRevalidation    flagged for review
//   singleTailAxis       an axis with only one authored tail — deliberate, or an oversight?
//   inconsistentReach    a Screened/Asserted condition that also claims to be detected by a signal
//   conjunctionOfOne     a condition combining its signals with `all` when it has fewer than two.
//                        `all` and `any` are the same test on one signal, so the field is either a
//                        leftover or an author part-way through adding the rest
//   screenedHasCause     a Screened cause with an incoming edge — the likeliest symptom of a
//                        wholly INVERTED graph, which no coverage count can detect
//   bothTailsOneCondition  one condition flagging BOTH sides of one measure's corridor. It fires
//                        whichever way the reading goes, so it cannot tell too much from too little
//   duplicateAlias       two conditions answer to one coach term. Search resolves to whichever came
//                        first in the file, so the term silently leads to the wrong page
//   externalDeviceNoReason  an ExternalDevice measure that does not name the device. The status says
//                        something is in the way; only the reason says what, and two surfaces quote it
//   unwatchedTailNoReason  a measure declaring a tail deliberately unwatched without saying why.
//                        The declaration silences `ungradedTail`; without the reason it is
//                        indistinguishable from a tail nobody has got to
//   faultNotObservable   a Fault that cannot be seen in the swing. Then it is not a swing fault; it
//                        is a Capacity or an Intent. THIS IS THE CHECK THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT
//                        `over_the_top`, which shipped Latent because nobody had written it a measure
//   kindReachMismatch    a Capacity not reached by a screen, or an Intent not reached by asking. One
//                        code for both, because an author fixes either the same way
//   outcomeNotBallFlight an Outcome outside the BallFlight group. The ONE rule coupling the two
//                        otherwise-orthogonal axes; if it ever fires legitimately, delete the rule
//   outcomeHasEffect     an Outcome that causes something. What the ball did cannot cause the swing
//                        that produced it, so this is an edge written back to front
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT A CHECK: "this condition has no prominence". It cannot be written here at all.
// Prominence has five legitimate values and no sentinel, so a row nobody authored and a row somebody
// authored at the default rung are THE SAME BYTES by the time the validator sees them — and 58 of
// the shipped conditions sit at that rung on purpose. Any predicate over the loaded pack either
// accuses those 58 or reports nothing. Giving the enum an eighth "unset" value would fix the
// predicate and break the thing the enum is for, which is that every condition has an answer.
// The failure it was meant to catch — a 146-row hand edit that stopped at 142 — is caught instead by
// `core_pack_test`, which reads the SHIPPED JSON as raw text and asserts the key is present on every
// condition. That is the only layer where the question is answerable, and it is also the only layer
// where it matters.
//
// The checks that span the pack, the norm set, the context tree and the metric catalogue at once —
// "can this signal ever fire?" — live in `diagnostics_health.h`, because no single pack can answer
// them.
// How a caller that HOLDS the metric catalogue answers "where does this metric mean anything?".
// Returns the metric's PhaseDomain (metric_descriptor.h); an unknown key must answer the whole swing,
// which is the default a descriptor carries.
//
// ASK, NEVER LOOK UP. This file still cannot see the catalogue, for the reason stated on the
// instrument-ladder check below — it must not start guessing at it. Supplying the resolver is
// therefore the caller's choice, and omitting it leaves every answer exactly as it is today: the
// domain defaults to the whole swing and no reducer can fall outside it.

// ONE rule, here, because a measure with no authored label is not an edge case: nine shipped
// measures carry `label: ""`, all of them `kind: "composed"`, and eight of the nine are `planned` or
// `noProducer` — exactly the rows an author is hunting for. Every surface that had its own fallback
// got a different answer, and the surfaces that had none rendered a blank row.
//
// The order matters and each step is load-bearing:
//   authored label   — an author's own words always win
//   canonical label  — Composed measures ARE their facets, so the series and the reducer name them
//                      ("Thoracic segment angle to ground, at P1") deterministically
//   id               — a last resort that cannot be reached by a well-formed Composed measure, but
//                      a Provided measure with no label has no facets to generate one from, and a
//                      nameless row is worse than an ugly one

// in either direction. SYMMETRIC, because corroboration is — which is why it is a separate function
// from causallyReaches() rather than a call to it with a comment. Asking this one about a CAUSAL
// edge refuses every legal shortcut (`A → B` where `A → X → B` already runs), and says "cycle" while
// doing it; that is what it used to do here, and it is what the two names now prevent.

// make every caller subtract it back out.
//
// This is causallyReaches() asked of every condition at once, and it exists because asking the
// singular form per candidate is the same traversal repeated N times. The graph's link drag needs
// the whole refusal set at the moment the drag arms (one walk, then O(1) per node); doing it per
// hover was measurably the wrong shape on a pack this size, and it also has to be answered for

// ── The metric → measure join ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Which measure reads `metricKey` at `phase`. This is the bridge between the two registries: the
// metric catalogue speaks in (key, phase) and the diagnostics pack speaks in measures, and every
// corridor the app renders has to cross that gap. `metric_corridor.h` carries the answer on to the
// norm that grades it; both live in the pack layer rather than in a QML façade, because every rule
// written inside a façade is a rule nothing can test.
//
// A measure matches a phase through its REDUCER, not through a phase field, because that is where
// the phase actually lives:
//   at        -> the anchor phase
//   delta     -> the window's END phase; the measure IS the change observed at that phase
//   rate      -> likewise the window's end
//   extremum  -> never matches. "The lowest lag angle between P5 and P6" is not a reading at P5 or
//                at P6, and returning it for either would attach a corridor to the wrong number.
//
// Ambiguity is possible and is resolved by preferring `at` over `delta`: both m_leadWristAtTop
// (at P4) and a Δ-from-address measure name P4 on the same metric, and the absolute reading is the
// one a corridor keyed on a phase means. Beyond that PACK ORDER wins — deterministic, but arbitrary,
// and a tie there means two measures describe one number. The validator warns about exactly that
// case (`duplicateMeasure`), because no downstream check can: both answers look correct.

// EVERY measure that reads `metricKey` at `phase`, in that preference order.
//
// Callers that must produce something need the whole list, not the winner. `m_leadWristAtTop` is the
// case that proves it: it is the preferred measure at P4 and carries NO norm, so a caller taking only
// the winner draws no corridor at the top of the swing while the Δ-from-address measure beside it has
// carried one since v1. Empty when nothing matches.
