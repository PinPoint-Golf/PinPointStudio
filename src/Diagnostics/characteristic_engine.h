    //       WHY NOT THE MIDPOINT HERE. A one-sided band's midpoint is halfway between the
    //       aspiration and the fault edge — a point the measure says nothing about — so a z built
    //       on it would put 0 where nothing happens and ±1 where nothing happens either.

    //       width. normZ() deliberately returns exactly 0 all along the open side of a one-sided
    //       norm, so a floor cleared by a hair and a floor cleared by a mile are the same number.
