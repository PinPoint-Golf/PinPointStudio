// Norms — the normative distribution a measured value is graded against.
//
// The out-of-line functions declared here — gradePolicyPresets, cohortProbeOrder, ageBandFor,
// cohortFor, normIsWeak, the enum <-> string conversions and the phrase builders near the bottom —
// are DEFINED in norm.cpp. The load/save and validation layer for a norm SET lives in norm_pack.h /
// norm_pack.cpp instead, which is a different concern (content persistence, not the grading model),
// and it is the reason the definitions are not there despite the similar filename.
//
// The word is `norm`, never "reference". `reference` is already taken: it is the "relative to" role
// in a measure's facets (Series::reference, CharacteristicEditorModel::referencesFor). A second
// meaning for the same word would collide in the API, the JSON and the UI at once.
//
// ALL NORMS ARE POPULATION NORMS. The inviolable rule is that a norm is NEVER KEYED BY ATHLETE ID,
// and nothing in this header should ever gain one — a norm that differs per player is a different
// feature with different storage and a different UI. Seating a norm from a selected set of swings
// (the editor's "seat from swings" route) records `n` and the selection scope in provenance, but the
// result still applies to everyone using that norm set.
//
// It used to read "one population for everyone", which the optional `Cohort` on the key retires: a
// cohort is a SEGMENTED population — men 55–64 — not a person. The rule that survives is the one
// about athlete ids, and it is the one that mattered.

// ── Cohort: the optional third term of the norm key ─────────────────────────
//
// A norm may be qualified by the POPULATION SEGMENT it describes. This is not a per-athlete norm and
// must never become one (see the header comment): a cohort names a group, the group is resolved from
// the athlete record at grading time, and the corridor still applies to everyone in it.
//
// Cohort is deliberately NOT a context node. The context tree describes the SHOT — club, shot type,
// archetype — while age and sex are properties of the ATHLETE. Folding one into the other would push
// the cross-product (senior × driver × female × …) through a single-inheritance walk that cannot
// express two orthogonal dimensions without duplicating every row on both.
//
// A COHORT SHIFTS THE CORRIDOR AND NEVER INVERTS VALENCE — the same rule context obeys. If a measure
// reads better high for one population it reads better high for all of them; what a cohort changes
// is where the corridor sits, never which way is good. That is also why `Shape` is on the MEASURE
// and not reachable from here: a cohort row that flipped the direction would not be a corridor for a
// different population, it would be a different measure wearing the same id.
//
// BAND-EDGE CLIFFS ARE ACCEPTED. A golfer's grade can shift on their 55th birthday. There is no
// interpolation between bands and there will not be: interpolating implies a continuity the banded
// literature does not support, and the coach mediates the edge case exactly as they already do for
// shot type.

enum class Sex { Male, Female };

// The age vocabulary is CLOSED and hierarchical: a fixed enum, stable tokens, changed only by a
// schema version bump and NEVER extended by pack content. That is the whole point. The model is
// community-maintained and the literature bands age every way imaginable, so a free numeric range
// would put study-specific arithmetic into the key, where nothing can reconcile it across packs. A
// study whose range does not match a band is mapped by the AUTHOR to the nearest one, with the
// study's actual range recorded verbatim in `citation` — the key stays comparable, the provenance
// stays honest.
//
// Half-open, gapless, total:
//
//     junior                under 18
//     adult                 18+           — a parent, and authorable in its own right
//       adult_18_54
//       adult_55_64
//       adult_65plus
//
// 55 is the seniors threshold in UK club practice, so a golfer already knows which side of it they
// are on and a coach does not have to explain the band. It sits ABOVE the point where the
// trunk-rotation decline literature usually pivots, and that is deliberate: a boundary set later
// than the physiological one means a 55+ row describes a population that has unambiguously started
// to decline, rather than one straddling the onset.
//
// `junior` is one band and is the weakest of them — a 9-year-old and a 17-year-old are barely one
// population — but there is no junior corpus to split against. If one arrives it splits at peak
// height velocity (~14), as a version bump.

// consequences — an unqualified `driver` row beats a senior row at `any` for a driver shot (stance
// width is club-mechanical; if senior-driver matters, author it), and a senior row at `any` resolves
// for a senior wherever no club-specific row exists, which is the ROM family, exactly where cohorts

// defaulted parameter to trail every non-defaulted one, so a required shape cannot sit after an
// optional policy. A caller passing both still writes them in the order that now matches grade()'s

// detail page's corridors (metric_corridor.h) — and each of them must draw the edge that
// grade() actually applies. A second copy is how a surface ends up showing a corridor the app does
// not use: the Watch edge is `monitorLo/Hi` when the norm states them and z-derived when it does
// not, and that precedence has to be stated once.
//
// EVERY edge here is policy-DEPENDENT. The Ideal edge is `mu -/+ idealMaxZ * sigma` and the Watch
// edge is `mu -/+ watchMaxZ * sigma` (or the explicit monitor band, which dominates). One edge,
// computed one way, on both the drawing path and the grading path.
//
// This was not always true. Until the fix, `idealLo/idealHi` here were `mu -/+ sigma` — the norm's
// own claim — while grade() applied `policy.idealMaxZ`. Under `standard` the two coincide; under
// `strict` and `lenient` they do not, and the band a surface drew was not the band the app graded.
//
// If you want the norm's own claim — for the editor's handles, or a diff against a shipped or
