// m_smashFactor is the first and only one-sided measure PinPoint ships. Everything the shapes work
// built is machinery; this is the one place that machinery meets real content, and the assertions
// here are about what a golfer's number now grades as.
//
// ⚠ The measure is `externalDevice` — it needs a launch monitor — so none of this is verifiable on
// a live swing today. That is why the behavioural delta is the gate: it is the only thing that can
// say the conversion did what it was for.
//
// This file deliberately does NOT pin mu or sigma. Those are heuristics and are expected to move
// when a corpus re-seats them; pinning them would fail the first time somebody did the right thing.
// It pins the SHAPE of the answer: which band a value lands in, and which side of the corridor is
// open. The one number it does pin is a plausibility cap, because a cap is a physical claim rather
// than a fitted one — it moves only if the physics was wrong.
