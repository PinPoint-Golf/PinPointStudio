// THE LAUNCH MONITOR PANEL'S CORRIDOR JOIN, on the shipped content.
//
// LmSessionModel::gradesFor() runs exactly the chain below — club string → context node →
// (metric, Impact) → measure → norm → Grade — and turns the answer into the one colour that panel
// carries. Every link is already tested somewhere; what is NOT tested anywhere else is the chain
// composed, against the real norm set, for the metrics a launch monitor actually reports. That is
// the thing that decides what a golfer sees, and it can be wrong in two directions that no compiler
// and no rendering test can catch:
//
//   · resolving at the WRONG CONTEXT. The panel is the first surface to grade a per-club corridor
//     from a club NAME rather than from a shot's declared context. Read at `full_swing`, spin rate
//     resolves the `any` row — 5000 +/- 2000 rpm, written to be too wide to ever fire — and the
//     board silently never colours anything. Everything still compiles, every unit test still
//     passes, and the feature does nothing. So the driver / iron / wedge rows are asserted to
//     actually separate: 2600 rpm is a good driver AND a badly bladed wedge, and the panel has to
//     say both.
//   · grading a metric NOBODY AUTHORED A NORM FOR. 18 of the 25 reading measures carry no norm in
//     any context, on purpose — several of them (ball speed, clubhead speed, peak height) are
//     capability rather than quality and should never carry one. The sweep below states which 7 do,
//     so authoring the 8th is a deliberate edit to a test rather than a colour that appears on a
//     golfer's board unannounced.
