// THE FIRST TIME THE PACK MEETS A REAL SWING.
//
// Everything upstream of this file is dark by design. characteristic_engine_test feeds synthetic
// values; norm_measure_source_test feeds a fake norm set; measure_sample_test reduces a
// hand-written phase grid. Each proves one link. NONE of them can fail if the shipped content is
// wrong about what a recorded swing carries, and that is precisely the failure this stage exists to
// find: 109 measures declare themselves `live`, and until something read a swing off disk nobody
// could say how many of them a capture actually answers.
//
// So this test is a KNOWN-GROUPS validation, not a unit test. The fixtures are real swings copied
// out of the corpus, the values asserted against them were computed independently from the
// JSON, and the coverage numbers are OBSERVED and pinned — they are a measurement of the pipeline,
// and the reason to pin them is that a silent drop from 30 assessable conditions to 3 looks exactly
// like a healthy run.
//
// ── The fixtures, and what each is for ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   rich_7iron      2026-07-10 Wrist_02 / swing_0001 — 43 metrics, 10 segmented phases, club 7 IRON.
//                   The best capture in the corpus, and therefore the ceiling on what today's
//                   producers can answer.
//
//                   ⚠ RE-COPIED FROM THE LIBRARY ON 2026-09-07, AND KEEP DOING THAT. It had been
//                   sitting here since 11 August, analysed by a build from before the P5/P6 ladder
//                   work — 5 phases and 39 metrics — so the ceiling it measured was the ceiling of
//                   a month-old pipeline, not of today's. Re-copying moved the coverage number
//                   from 54 to 63 and the resolved measures from 39 to 53, which is nine
//                   conditions the model could already answer and this file was reporting that it
//                   could not. It also replaced a 41° impact shaft lean — not a golf swing — with
//                   12.5°, and with it a `excessive_shaft_lean` firing that had only ever been an
//                   artefact of the bad number.
//
//                   A STALE FIXTURE UNDERSTATES THE MODEL AND IT DOES IT SILENTLY: every number
//                   below still passes, so nothing says the yardstick has drifted. Re-copy it
//                   whenever the analysis pipeline changes materially, and re-pin what moves.
//   lm_7iron        2026-08-04 Wrist_05 / swing_0025 — 25 lm.* metrics from a GCQuad, ONE phase
//                   (impact), no body metrics at all. The launch-monitor half of the vocabulary.
//   sparse_noclub   2026-07-08 Wrist_01 / swing_0002 — one metric, four phases, and no review block
//                   so no declared club. The degradation case.
//   lm_partial      2026-08-04 Wrist_05 / swing_0004 — the SAME monitor on the same session
//                   reporting 13 of its 25 fields, which is what makes "your monitor did not report
//                   this" a real state rather than a branch invented to fill out an enum. 8 KB, so
//                   it is cheaper to carry than to argue about.
//
// rich_7iron is the ONE fixture that is not byte-for-byte its original: `analysis.pose2d` was
// dropped, taking it from 33 MB to 1.5 MB. Nothing in this chain reads pose2d — buildPhaseGrid()
// consumes `analysis.metrics` and `analysis.phases` and readPhaseGrid() the identity fields — and a
// 33 MB blob of per-frame landmarks in the source tree is a cost every clone pays forever. Every
// metric, every phase, every sample is verbatim.
//
// The fixtures are COPIED TO A TEMPORARY DIRECTORY before use, because readPhaseGrid() writes a
// swing_phasegrid.json sidecar beside the document it parses and a test must not leave artefacts in
// the source tree. It also means the sidecar write/reload path is exercised on real data.
