    // The example was pelvisSway, then pelvisRotation, and BOTH have since left — which is the
    // roadmap working exactly as intended and is the reason this assertion keeps having to move.
    // Pelvis rotation left when body_rotation.cpp landed: it is rotation about the vertical axis, so
    // a frontal projection cannot see it directly, but the image span of the hip line collapses by
    // its cosine, and an honest estimate with a stated uncertainty beat leaving seven
    // characteristics dark.
    //
    // The exemplar is now spine forward bend, which is a genuinely different case: it is SAGITTAL,
    // the plane a face-on camera foreshortens to almost nothing, and no clever reading of the
    // frontal projection recovers it.
    //
    // It was two reducers over one series with three characteristics behind them until 2026-09-22,
    // when the down-the-line posture rung was built (848512a3) and m_spineBendDive gained a producer.
    // A measure going live takes its characteristic off the roadmap with it, so `diving` left and the
    // row is now ONE reducer — m_spineBendAtAddress, still planned — over TWO characteristics,
    // posture_too_upright and posture_too_bent. The ROW itself survives exactly because that one
    // measure is still planned, which is what the first assertion below still measures.
    //
    // So this row has now shrunk both ways the file knows about: once because a fault was re-authored
    // off a sagittal measure (below), and once because somebody finally built the camera rung that
    // reads it. The second is the one this roadmap exists to produce.
    //
    // It was four until `loss_of_posture` became `coming_out_of_it` and moved off this series onto
    // head lift and trunk lean — two readings a face-on camera already resolves. That is the one
    // way a roadmap row shrinks without anybody writing a producer: the fault was never sagittal,
    // it was authored against a sagittal measure.
