// The value types of a characteristic pack. Header-only, Qt-only, no Qt-GUI.
//
// This file carries TWO of the pack's three vocabularies: the CONDITION GRAPH (Condition, Edge,
// CharacteristicPack — what can go wrong and what causes it) and the PROVENANCE POLICY helpers near
// the bottom (how well sourced a claim has to be). The third, what a MEASURE is and how a Signal
// tests it, lives in measure_vocabulary.h — split out so a reader who only needs "what is a Measure"
// is not also pulled into the causal model.
//
// The one structural idea that shapes the graph here: FAULTS AND CAUSES ARE THE SAME TYPE. A
// Condition is a named state of the swing or the golfer; whether it is a fault or a cause is
// resolved per-swing by the explanation pass and is never stored. That is what lets a condition be
// cited by several characteristics AND have causes of its own — early extension causes loss of
// posture, and both are conditions.

// How well sourced a claim is — and, just as importantly, whether anybody has LOOKED.
//
// `Proposed` and `NoSourceFound` are the pair that carries the most information between them.
// Collapsed into one value (which is what shipped for a year) the library cannot distinguish "we
// have not checked this" from "we checked and the literature is silent", and those call for
// opposite actions: the first is a task, the second is a finding. A null result is a result, and it
// is only worth anything if it records WHEN it was taken — see `Provenance::searchedOn`.
//
// `Indirect` exists because of what golf literature actually contains. A paper will establish that
// limited hip internal rotation produces greater lumbopelvic compensation; it will not test
// "early extension", because that is a coaching label and not a measured variable. Filing such a
// source under Supported would make the citation look like it backs the EDGE when it backs the
// reasoning behind the edge — the same overclaim in a different costume.
// `Practice` is the tier for a claim that coaching teaches universally and nobody has tested. That
// is NOT the same as unsupported — a fault every competent coach works from is evidence of a kind,
// and filing it as NoSourceFound would throw away the distinction between "the field is silent" and
// "the field agrees but has never measured it".
//
// It carries no citation WHERE THE SOURCE IS A COMMERCIAL SCREENING OR LAUNCH-MONITOR BODY, and
// there the absence is forced rather than lazy: this repo's standing rule is that the TERMS are
// common domain while the ATTRIBUTION must not enter the content in any form — not a citation, not
// an author, not a note. `core_pack_test` greps the raw bytes for exactly that. So the tier records
// the STATE of the evidence and `searchTerms` records what was looked for; naming who says it is
// what we cannot do, and it is also the part that carries the least information.
//
// It MAY carry one where the source is a PUBLISHED BOOK. Coaching doctrine has a documented
// literature going back decades, an ISBN names it without naming a vendor, and "the field agrees
// but has never measured it" is better evidence when we can say who the field is. No code change
// was needed to permit this — `citationRequired(Practice)` is already false and nothing forbids a
// citation on the tier — so this comment is the code catching up with what it always allowed, and
// it is the thing a future author would otherwise get wrong. The guard that keeps it honest sits
// one tier up: a book citation may not hold `Supported` or `Established` (reference_pack.h).

// holds fourteen physical screens, nine beliefs and a set of clubs.
//
// The distinction the library could not previously make is between a movement error a lesson is
// about, an impact geometry that is merely the scoreboard, and a physical capacity that constrains
// what is coachable at all. All three were `Condition` with a group and two epistemic flags — and
// with nothing recording the kind, those flags absorbed the job. `over_the_top` shipped `Latent` and
// `Asserted`, which the headers below define as "cannot be seen in the swing" and "intent, habit,
// perception". It is neither. It was tagged that way because nobody had written it a measure, so the
// fields had quietly become a record of PRODUCER COVERAGE rather than a statement about the thing.
//
// The repair is the division of labour these three now keep:
//
//   ConditionKind   what sort of thing it is.      INTRINSIC — never moves when a producer lands.
//   Observability   can it be seen in the swing.   INTRINSIC to the movement.

//   "explains none of these findings". That collapses "we see this, rarely" into "this is not a
//   candidate", and those are precisely the two states this field exists to hold apart. A Rare fault
