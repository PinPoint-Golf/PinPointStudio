// Reading a MEASURE off a swing that is already on disk.
//
// This is the missing half of norm_measure_source.h. `IMeasureValueSource` declares the seam — "a
// value source knows what the swing did and knows nothing about what is normal" — but until now
// nothing implemented it outside a test fake, so nothing in the app could put a real number next to
// a norm. The corridor editor's live histogram is not decoration: a corridor grading almost
// everything Action is only visibly wrong if there are real swings drawn beneath it.
//
// ── Why a phase grid and not the measures themselves ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious cache is "measureId -> value per swing". It is the wrong one: the pack is EDITABLE,
// so minting a measure would stale every sidecar in the library and force a full re-parse of a
// 2 GB corpus to look at one new corridor.
//
// A measure is a metric series reduced at phases, and the phases are a property of the SWING, not
// of the pack. So the cache stores the grid the reduction reads — per metric, the value at each
// segmented phase plus the extremes between adjacent phases — and the reduction happens in memory.
// New measures over already-produced metrics then cost nothing, which is exactly the case the
// editor creates.
//
// ── Why adjacent-phase spans ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An Extremum reducer searches a window for a peak, which the phase values alone cannot answer: a
// pelvis that sways back and recovers before the next phase has a peak no endpoint sees, and that
// is the entire reason Extremum is first-class (metric_reducer.h). Storing min/max between each
// pair of ADJACENT segmented phases makes any phase-bounded window exact by aggregation, at a cost
// linear in phases rather than quadratic.
//
// "EXACT BY AGGREGATION" RESTS ON ONE RULE, and it is the reducers' rule, not this module's:
// A CANDIDATE'S SUPPORT IS QUERY-INDEPENDENT. reduceExtremum scores a sample over every VALID sample
// within its window (widening unclamped until the sample floor is met) — the neighbourhood comes
// from the CURVE, never from the search bounds. So the union of the spans' candidate sets is the
// whole window's candidate set, every candidate scores the same in a span as in a whole-window
// query, and min/max being idempotent makes the shared boundary sample harmless. That is why this
// cache can answer a multi-span window at all, and why it answers what the review chart answers.
//
// The rule was briefly broken by clamping a candidate's support to [from, to], to stop an extremum
// borrowing samples from outside a metric's domain. Measured on rich_7iron that cost 20 of 514
// engine-vs-card agreements (worst 1.45 on clubheadSpeed P1→P10 max), and it has no per-span fix:
// under a query-dependent support a sample 10 ms before a phase is scored over a truncated window
// inside its span and a full one inside the whole query, so no cached span is reusable.
//
// THE DOMAIN IS A MASK, NOT A CLAMP — that is the fix, and it belongs to the producers. A metric
// narrower than the swing marks the samples outside its Address→Impact domain `valid = 0` in
// swing.json (design §5.1), and both consumers already honour that mask: an out-of-domain sample is
// then neither a candidate nor part of anyone's support, at every window, without any reducer
// needing to know where a domain ends. See the mask note in buildPhaseGrid below.
//
// ── Sampling convention ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A SHORT WINDOWED MEDIAN about each phase timestamp — the same convention WristAngleSampler
// already uses, from the same tuned constants. Deliberately not a second convention: the wrist grid
// and a norm seated from the corridor editor must be reading the same number off the same swing, or
// the two surfaces disagree about what the golfer did.
//
// The arithmetic itself is not written here any more: both the phase values and the span extremes
// come from `src/Analysis/series_reduce.h`, the one implementation the REVIEW CHART also reduces
// through (design §5.2). That is not tidiness — a corridor is authored by looking at the chart, so a
// card and an engine that reduced the same curve with two hand-rolled loops would eventually
// disagree about the number the corridor was drawn around, and nothing on screen would say so.
//
// Where the curve has nothing in the window, the metric's own `phaseSamples` reading is used
// instead. That fallback is not a nicety: an entire CLASS of metric ships with an empty curve and
// nothing but phaseSamples — every setup metric in a real swing.json (stanceWidth, ballPosition,
// tempoRatio, the foot-flare and toe-line angles) is read once at a position and has no curve to
// sample. Reading only the curve produced nothing for all of them, and the symptom is
// indistinguishable from "no swing carries this measure".

namespace pinpoint::analysis {

// The schema this build writes. A sidecar declaring a HIGHER version is ignored and rebuilt rather
// than partially read — it is a pure cache, so discarding it is always safe.
//
// 2: `club` now resolves through swingDocClub() (review.club, else capture.club.name, else the
//    stub). A v1 sidecar cached the review-or-stub answer and its size+mtime guard still matches,
//    since the fix rewrote no swing.json — the version bump is what retires it.
// 3: `spans` min/max are the extremes of the CENTRED-WINDOW MEAN (±extremumWindowUs/2) instead of
//    the extremes of the raw samples (design §5.2). Every Extremum measure's value therefore moves,
//    typically toward the mean by about one σ, and a v2 sidecar's size+mtime guard still matches the
//    unchanged swing.json — so as with v1, the version bump is the ONLY thing that retires the
//    stale numbers. `values` are untouched: the same ±15 ms median, now computed by reduceAt().
// 4: spans are CLOSED at both ends, a zero-width span is not stored at all, and the endpoint-median
//    seed is gone from the aggregation (see PhaseGridSpan and reduceOverGrid). Together those three
//    were making the engine disagree with the review chart on 36 of 170 extremum cases on one corpus
//    swing, by up to 9.4° — and a cache is only worth having if it answers what the chart answers.
// 5: every value and span carries the measurement σ, gross risk and where the σ came from
//    (session_diagnostics_design.md §A8.3). Additive — the numbers are unchanged — but a v4 sidecar
//    has no σ to serve, so the bump retires it.

// changes no answer and half-openness bought nothing; and the review chart's own candidate set over
// a phase window IS closed, so a sample sitting exactly on the opening instant was a peak candidate
// for the card and not for the engine. On one corpus swing that alone put the two surfaces 9.4°

//

// phase's windowed median nor a span's extremes, and a phase whose whole window is bridged gets no
// entry — the same path an unsampled phase already takes. The key is written only when something is
// invalid, so a swing without it grids identically to a swing carrying an all-ones mask — which is
// what makes the mask additive. (It no longer means "identical to the previous release": schema 3
// moved every span. `values` are still identical either way, and that is what the mask tests pin.)

// nullopt => this measure could not be produced FOR THIS SWING: no such metric, or a phase the
// reducer needs was never segmented. Never a zero, because "not assessed" and "assessed and fine"
// are different statements and the whole Diagnostics module exists to keep them apart.
//
// Extremum semantics, made explicit because metric_reducer.h's own comment is ambiguous: the result
// is the SIGNED deviation `extremum(window, sense) - value(anchor)`, not `max |value - anchor|`. An
// absolute deviation cannot carry a `sense`, and every anchored Extremum in the shipped pack means
// the signed reading — m_pelvisSwayBack is the most negative sway relative to address, not the
// largest excursion in either direction.
//
// An Extremum is the aggregate of the SPANS the window covers and nothing else. It used to be seeded
// with the two endpoint windowed medians as well, on the reasoning that a peak sitting on a phase is
// still a peak — but a ±15 ms median and a 40 ms windowed mean are two different smoothing scales,
// and mixing them in one min/max made the engine report numbers the chart cannot produce (36 of 170
// extremum cases on one corpus swing). The endpoints lie inside the closed spans anyway, so nothing
// is lost. The medians survive only as a LAST RESORT: when no span in the window answered at all —
// every interval zero-width or wholly bridged — min/max of the two endpoint values still beats
// darkening a measure whose value is sitting right there, and it is what the chart falls back to.
