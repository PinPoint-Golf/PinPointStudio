// This is what finally makes MeasureReading::hasCorridor true. The seed pack's 30 corridor signals
// have been dark since they were authored, not because nothing produced their values but because
// nothing produced their corridors — the engine correctly reported Unavailable and the whole
// library detected nothing.
//
// The split is deliberate: a VALUE source knows what the swing did and knows nothing about what is
// normal; this decorator knows what is normal and nothing about the swing. Neither has to grow the
// other's dependencies, and a test can swap either half.

//                            demotes the finding's confidence in the engine. The deviation is real;
//                            what is uncertain is whether the right norm judged it.
//   * declared but unknown — resolves to NOTHING. Grading an unrecognised context against the
//                            full-swing norm would be a wrong answer wearing a right answer's
//                            clothes, so the measure reports as having no corridor and the
