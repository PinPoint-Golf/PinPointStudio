enum class MeasureKind {
    Composed,   // built from facets: a Series sampled by a Reducer
    Provided,   // a first-class metric we ship with a producer (tempo ratio, X-factor, sequence)
};

enum class MeasureStatus {
    Live,           // a producer exists today
    Planned,        // a producer is planned
    NoProducer,     // nothing produces it yet — ROADMAP work, someone could pick this up
    NotCapturable,  // no sensor this product has can ever resolve it — a CAPTURE GAP, not roadmap
    ExternalDevice, // a producer is intended, but it reads from hardware the user may not own
    Held,           // a producer exists and runs, but the measure is deliberately NOT graded yet
};

// Held exists because Planned was being used for two different facts. A DTL posture series that
// ships every shot, but whose conditions have no authored cause (or whose measure has no norm), is
// not pipeline work — the number is on screen — yet grading it would fire a fault nobody can
// explain. It is treated exactly as Planned by everything that grades or counts live measures, and
// differs only in what it SAYS: "held", with `gapReason` naming what content is owed. Appended, not
// inserted: the enum's int is used as a sort key.

// The distinction between NoProducer and NotCapturable is the whole reason the roadmap can be
// trusted as a work queue. NoProducer means "we could build this"; NotCapturable means "a different
// sensor or view is required, and listing it as missing pipeline work would mislead every reader".
//
// ExternalDevice is the third answer, and it is not a shade of either. A launch monitor resolves
// face angle, spin and strike location; integrating one is work we intend to do, so calling it
// NotCapturable would be false. But the work is an INTEGRATION, not a producer written from our own
// pixels, and a roadmap row reading "build a spin-axis producer" would send somebody the wrong way.
// So it is roadmap-eligible and sectioned apart. The per-shot half lives on the requirement
// (MetricRequirement::launchMonitor): a user with no launch monitor gets "needs a launch monitor"
// through the same path a missing face-on camera already takes, which is what makes the absence
// graceful rather than a hole. `gapReason` is required here exactly as it is for NotCapturable.
//
// WHY THE VOCABULARY HOLDS SOME QUANTITIES TWICE — once as our own estimate (m_launchAngle,
// m_ballSpeed, m_attackAngle, m_clubPathAtImpact…) and once as a launch-monitor reading
// (m_lmLaunchAngle, m_lmBallSpeed, m_lmAttackAngle, m_lmClubPath…). The pairs look like drift and
// are deliberate, for two reasons that pull in the same direction. First, not every user owns a
// launch monitor, so every ball-flight quantity a diagnosis can rest on must be producible from
// our own pixels; the m_* rows are that commitment, and the `planned` ones among them are roadmap,
// not leftovers. Second, for a user who owns both, the two are INDEPENDENT measurements of one
// event — and the monitor's reading is the standard our estimate is validated against. One merged
// measure could do neither job: it would leave monitor-less users without the quantity, and a
// measure cannot validate itself. Resolution is an exact metricKey match with no fallback
// (measure_sample.cpp), so which of the pair a signal binds to is a per-quantity authoring
// decision made where the signal is written — not something a loader infers from what happens to
// be plugged in.

// Which way a measure's corridor is open.
//
// ON THE MEASURE, NOT THE NORM, and that is the load-bearing decision. One-sidedness is semantics
// of the QUANTITY and invariant across contexts: smash factor has no upper fault with a driver and
// none with a wedge either, only a different implausibility. If shape sat on the norm, a driver row
// and an iron row could disagree about the shape of one measure and the corridor editor could flip
// shape per context — so a norm row carries only NUMBERS, and validateNormsAgainst checks those
// numbers against the measure's shape exactly the way it already checks `unit`.
//
// This changes which values reach which band. It does NOT add a band: Ideal/Good/Watch/Action/
// NotMeasured and ragOf() are untouched, and a one-sided norm consults the same z ladder on its one
// graded tail.
//
// The open tail is open UP TO PLAUSIBILITY, not to infinity — see Norm::plausibleLo/plausibleHi. A
// driver smash of 1.62 is not a swing finding, it is a mis-tracked ball, and grading it either way
// would launder a capture fault into a confident diagnosis.
//
// `Floor` is for self-normalising ratios and mechanically-universal thresholds ONLY. Cohort-relative
// bigger-is-better outcomes — ball speed, club speed, carry — get no norm at all: a population floor
// on those grades a golfer Action for their age. They are benchmarks, a different feature.

};

    // instead of facets, but a catalogue TimeSeries is still a curve: metric_type.h describes it as
    // "reduced to peak / @impact / Δ / rate by the chart layer". Three characteristics can sit on
    // one live series at different phases (sway, slide and hanging back are all pelvis lateral
    // displacement), and modelling that as three separate metrics would be the parallel registry

    // every measure; `metricKey` alone is still the ordinary case.
    //
    // This is the answer to a question the paragraph above ("why the vocabulary holds some
    // quantities twice") left open, and it does not reopen it. The pairs stay: m_attackAngle is
    // still our estimate and m_lmAttackAngle is still the device's reading, separately addressable,
    // so the validation comparison a golfer who owns both is entitled to is untouched — a measure
    // still cannot validate itself. What changes is what a DIAGNOSIS binds to. Before this, a
    // signal had to name one instrument for ever: `attack_too_steep` named our projected estimate,
    // so a golfer with a launch monitor plugged in was diagnosed from the camera while the device's
    // own attack angle sat in the document read by nothing at all.
    //
    // AUTHORED, NOT INFERRED, which is the distinction that matters. The loader does not decide
    // anything from what happens to be plugged in; it walks a list somebody wrote in the measure
    // row, best first, and takes the first key this swing actually carries. That is the same
    // best-first ladder MetricRoute already uses one layer down, for the same reason: which
    // instrument is better is a per-quantity judgement, and it belongs where it can be read.
    //

    // twice, so a corridor authored in degrees has to mean degrees whichever rung answered;
