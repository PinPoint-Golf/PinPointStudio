// Two rules do most of the work here, and both exist to stop the output being confidently wrong.
//
// 1. A CHARACTERISTIC WITH AN IN-PACK CAUSE IS NEVER A ROOT. The graph is not two clean layers —
//    observable characteristics legitimately cause other observable characteristics (early
//    extension causes loss of posture; casting causes scooping). Presenting a leaf as a root would
//    hand the coach a symptom and call it the diagnosis.
//
// 2. AN `Asserted` CAUSE IS OFFERED, NEVER CONCLUDED. Intent, habit and perception are knowable
//    only by asking. They are surfaced, visually distinct, phrased as a question — but they never
//    count as resolving a finding. Dropping them instead would leave characteristics whose only
//    cause is habit with an empty explanation panel, when the truthful answer is "this may simply
//    be how they set up".

// A cause the resolver is putting forward, with what it accounts for.
