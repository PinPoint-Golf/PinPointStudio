// THE LIVE VALUE SOURCE: a recorded swing, read as measures.
//
// `IMeasureValueSource` has been the seam since the engine was written and every implementation of
// it so far has been a test fake. This is the first one that reads a swing off disk, and it is the
// point where the pack stops being a document and starts making claims about a golfer.
//
// It owns almost no arithmetic. `measure_sample.h` already parses a swing.json into a
// SwingPhaseGrid and reduces a Measure over it with nullopt-never-zero semantics; the pack already
// resolves a measureId to a Measure. This class is the JOIN of those two plus one thing neither
// could carry alone — WHY a measure produced nothing.
//
// ── Why the missing reason is a first-class output ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `std::optional<Value>` is the right return type and it is a lossy one. A review panel showing a
// greyed cell has to say something in it, and the four sentences below are genuinely different
// pieces of advice: buy a launch monitor, re-record with the camera further back, wait for a
// producer we have not written, or nothing at all because the pack does not carry that measure.
// Folding them into one "not available" would make the greyed half of the panel unreadable, and
// inventing a reason we cannot support would be worse — this is why the vocabulary below is
// MECHANICAL. "Metric not produced on this capture" is a statement about our own pipeline and is
// always true when it is said. "Shaft occluded at P6" would be a guess about a camera we cannot
// see, dressed as a diagnosis, and there is no code path here that could know it.
//
// ── What this class deliberately does not do ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It attaches no corridor and no grade — that is `NormMeasureSource`, and the split is the one
// norm_measure_source.h argues for: a value source knows what the swing did and knows nothing about
// what is normal. `detectForSwing()` at the bottom of this header is the convenience that stacks
// the two for one swing, and it is the whole of what a session model needs to call.

namespace pinpoint::analysis {

// WHY a measure could not be read. The `None` member is not padding: a caller iterating the pack
// wants one lookup that answers both "did this resolve" and "why not", and an empty QString for
// success is a sentinel a reader has to know about.
//
// An ENUM as well as a sentence because the two have different lifetimes. The sentence is UI copy
// and will be reworded, translated and shortened; the token is what a test pins and what a caller
// switches on to decide whether to offer "connect a launch monitor". Deriving either from the other
// would tie a behaviour to a string somebody is going to edit.

    NoMetricBinding,            // the measure names no metricKey — Composed, or authored ahead of a producer
    NoAnalysis,                 // the swing carries no phase grid at all: unanalysed, or unsegmented
    NoLaunchMonitor,            // an lm.* measure, and this shot has no launch-monitor data whatever
    LaunchMonitorFieldAbsent,   // there IS launch-monitor data; this device did not report this field
    MetricNotProduced,          // the metric key is absent from this capture's analysis

    // undeclared club from a declared driver, so `contextId()` never reports the undeclared case
    // and `NormMeasureSource::contextInferred` never trips through this path. A caller that knows
