// The one canonical golf-bag club vocabulary, driver → putter. SINGLE SOURCE OF
// TRUTH for every club picker in the app — the shot-carousel swing-edit popover
// (ShotListModel::clubOptions, persisted to swing.json review.club) and the Markup
// Lab metadata panel (MarkupController::clubOptions, persisted to truth.json
// meta.club). Both must offer the same labels so one physical swing never carries
// two differently-spelled club strings across its sidecars.
//
// Uppercase to match the carousel display font and the capture-time "DRIVER" stub,
// so an unedited shot's club maps to a picker row. Adding/renaming a club here
// changes it everywhere at once.

// have resolved to the default context instead. It survives only because the carousel and
// the picker have always shown a club for every row. swingDocClub() below exists to make
// reaching this line rare: every document written since capture.club.name landed carries

// WHICH CLUB A SWING WAS HIT WITH, from its swing.json root. THE one resolver — the
// session-picker summary (swing_doc.cpp) and the diagnostics phase grid
// (measure_sample.cpp) both call it, so a per-club filter can never bucket the same swing
// two ways.
//
// Precedence, most authoritative first:
//   1. review.club     — the user's own pick or correction, made in the swing-edit
//                        popover, and the only one of the three a human typed.
//   2. capture.club.name — the session's active club at the instant of the shot
//                        (Home CLUB chip → SessionController::activeClub → the export
//                        job). Written by the camera path, which has no review block
//                        until the shot is edited; without this step every unedited
//                        camera swing read back as the stub.
//   3. the stub        — nothing declared it. Pre-dates capture.club.name; unrecoverable.
// THE SAME RESOLUTION WITHOUT THE STUB — empty when nothing declared the club. For a PICKER
// row the stub is a kindness (every row shows a club); for a CORRIDOR it is a lie: an
// undeclared club graded as a driver is graded against driver ball position, driver stance
// width, driver shaft lean and driver smash, and on 2026-09-14 that was 58 of 123 corpus
// shots — every camera swing recorded before capture.club.name existed — firing
// stance_narrow on 95 % and excessive_shaft_lean on 62 % of "driver" shots that were an
// iron in the frame. The diagnostics phase grid reads THIS; an empty answer resolves to
// the default (full-swing) context, whose corridors were authored not to know the club.
