// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for analysis-pipeline parameters that are tuned during
// the validation programme and then FROZEN (docs/validation/pipeline_validation_and_tuning.md
// §2.4). When validation locks a value, edit it HERE and every consumer — live IMU
// path AND offline analyzer — picks it up; the tuned_constants_parity_test guards that
// the indirection stays byte-identical to the historical defaults.
//
// These are the DEFAULTS. SwingLab sweeps them at run time via the dotted-key
// `tuningOverrides` mechanism (analysis_tuning.h) without rebuilding — this header is
// not consulted on the override path, only for the baseline value an override starts from.
//
// LAYERING: src/Core is the lowest common layer (both src/IMU and src/Analysis already
// include from it). To keep `orientation_filter.h` Qt-free and standalone-unit-testable,
// this header carries ONLY numeric literals (no Qt types, no module types). Quaternions
// are expressed as {w, x, y, z} float arrays; imu_calibration.h builds the QQuaternion.
//
// NOT here (deliberately): the wrist axis SIGN conventions and ZXY decomposition in
// src/Analysis/wrist_angles.h — those are sign/axis CHOICES baked into code structure,
// not single numeric literals, and stay at their source of truth. The reference-band lo/hi
// corridor arrays are no longer code at all — they are norm rows in
// src/Resources/diagnostics/norms.json, edited as content and re-seated from a corpus.

// (`phased2.wrwire`). Move the strap and this must be re-selected.
//
// Chosen by `tools/hm_frame_select.py` from a directed capture, on the sign of
// a known bow and a known ulnar deviation — NOT on cross-talk, which all four
// candidates pass identically. Evidence from that capture:
//   · calibration applied     relative angle 6.82° → 2.03° across the 0x94
//   · axis roles MEASURED     flexion joint axis 19.7°/14.5° from device X,
//                             deviation 16.5°/14.4° from device Z, each ≥74.6°
//                             from the nearest other axis
//   · limb axis MEASURED      forearm rate axis 2.0° from device Y, 99%
//                             single-axis
//   · sign consistency        2/2 bursts agreed in each DOF
//
// ⚠ C2 inverts flexion relative to the device's own reported sense, and that is
// the expected result, not a red flag: we report ISB (flexion positive) and the
// vendor reports the inverse on bow/cup. A correct selection looks wrong beside
// their application. See docs/design/pinpoint_sign_conventions.md Rule 0.
//
// REPEATABILITY — MEASURED, not assumed. Three captures on one uninterrupted
// mounting (`phased2/3/4.wrwire`), each with its own run of the calibration
// routine, all select C2; the two richer ones agree on all THREE DOFs including
// the rotation. So the selection is a property of the mounting and not of the
// calibration attempt, which is what baking it in requires.
//
// ⚠ AND A REPRODUCIBLE ~17-18° RESIDUAL, WHICH IS NOT A FRAME ERROR AND MUST NOT
// BE "CORRECTED" AWAY. Real single-axis motions sit 17.0/13.9/20.9° off the
// device X for flexion and 15.5/21.6/18.2° off the device Z for deviation, and
// the offsets point the same way across captures (deviation means agree to
// 3.7-10.2°). Two reasons that is a measurement of the golfer rather than of the
// device: both frames here are CONVENTIONAL — defined by landmarks, not by
// measured helical axes — and a real human wrist's flexion and deviation axes
// are oblique to them, so the residual is what an anatomy-versus-convention gap
// looks like. `wrist_angles.h` already records 10-15° of the same family on our
// own Witmotion lane. Folding it into R would bake ONE golfer's anatomy into a
// mounting constant, which is precisely the one-golfer trap that stalled the
// earlier per-swing wrist work. Recorded here so the next reader treats an 18°
// cross-talk reading as expected rather than as a defect.

//
//   · on the lead hand, where HackMotion gives a right answer, filtering improved

// Why the group exists: ONE σ_jerk (2.0e5 px/s³) is shared by every body keypoint and

// (pelvisSway, hipLineTilt, plumbBobDistance, leadKneeDrift) carries keypoint noise
// the smoother could have averaged away: p95 frame-to-frame jitter of 3.1° on
// hipLineTilt and a whole-swing PK RATE of 291°/100 ms on the motivating swing.
//
// The window scales as σ_jerk^(−1/3) (the Wiener-cutoff argument in pose_smoother.cpp,

// --- Sparse-channel resample (src/Analysis/metric_channel.h) ------------------
// Every face-on producer resamples its sparse channel onto the full frame grid,

// kMaxBridgeUs is where a bridge stops being a measurement: a grid sample farther
// than this from any real channel sample is filled as before but MARKED INVALID in

// phase sample is taken there.
//
// 60 ms is chosen so that today's behaviour survives where it was honest and stops
// where it was not: a one- or two-frame confidence dropout at 150 fps (7–13 ms) still
// bridges silently, and a run of frames a geometry gate refused — a body line turned
// out of the image plane for a tenth of a second — does not.
//
// ⚠ A FIXED BUDGET IS NOT ENOUGH, and kBridgeSpacingFactor is why. The grid is NOT
// uniformly sampled: PoseRunner poses every frame only inside the dense zone, and the
// address region is sampled at addressStride 15 (≈100 ms at 150 fps) or coarseStride 12
// (≈80 ms) — pose_runner.h. A single dropped frame there is 80–100 ms from its
// neighbours, so a fixed 60 ms would mark it invalid, and that is the wrong answer: in a
// sparsely posed STILL address, holding the previous value across one missing sample is a
// hold, not a fabrication. So the allowance is

// dense (≈8 ms) and the 60 ms floor dominates, so a genuinely gated run is still marked.
// At 1.5 a sample bridges while it is within one-and-a-half spacings of a measurement, so a

// is marked — one dropped frame is a hold, a run of them is a fabrication.

// --- Robust series reducers (src/Analysis/series_reduce.h) ---------------------
// The windows the CHART SUMMARY and the DIAGNOSTICS PHASE GRID both reduce with, so the card and
// the corridors cannot disagree about the same word. Design
// docs/design/metric_presentation_honesty.md §5.2; the At window is sampler::kWindowHalfUs above,
// which measure_sample.cpp has always used and which the chart now adopts.
//
// Both are stated in TIME because the grid is not uniformly sampled (≈8 ms inside the dense pose
// zone, 27 ms outside it, 80–100 ms at the address end — pose_runner.h): a window counted in
// SAMPLES would be 40 ms mid-swing and half a second at address.
//
// kExtremumWindowUs (40 ms) is the support a PEAK has to have. The extremum is taken over the
// centred-window MEAN, so a one-sample outlier cannot be the peak — it has to be there for 40 ms.
// 40 ms is ≈5 samples in the dense zone and ≈2 outside it: long enough that the jitter (0.5° median,
// 3.1° at the 95th percentile on the 2026-08-18 corpus swing) averages down by √5, and short enough
// that a real excursion is not flattened — the pelvis and thorax quantities this protects move over
// 100–300 ms, and impact itself is located to ±5 ms by other means, not by this.
//
// kRateWindowUs (50 ms) is the minimum TIME BASE a rate may be fitted over, and it is the whole fix
// for the PK RATE numbers in design §2: an adjacent-frame difference at 8 ms spacing turns half a
// degree of jitter into 6°/100 ms and the 95th-percentile 3° into 37°/100 ms. A least-squares slope
// over 50 ms divides the noise by roughly √n and the time base by 6. Reported per 100 ms as it
// always has been.
//
// kMinExtremumSamples (3) is what stops the centred window from being a SINGLE SAMPLE where the
// grid is sparse, which is the failure the corpus probe found after the first cut of this work: at
// 27 ms spacing a ±20 ms window holds exactly one sample, so the "windowed mean" was the sample and
// the reducer did nothing at all across the address and the backswing (every still-address row
// printed peakSigma 0.000 — the tell). The window widens symmetrically until it holds this many
// valid samples, or until the reduction's own [from, to] leaves nothing further to add. 3 is the
// same floor kMinRateSamples uses and for the same reason: it is the smallest window that has a
// residual left over after a straight line, so the peak's sigma means something.
//
// kMinRateSamples (3) is the floor that stops a "slope" being a line through two points, which has
// no residual and therefore no standard error to be honest with. A window with fewer — a sparsely
// posed address — yields NO rate rather than a confident one. THIS one is enforced at 3 in code
// whatever is configured here — a two-point fit's zero standard error reads as certainty — where
// kMinExtremumSamples above is a target the widening aims at and 1 legitimately restores the

//
// kMinStanceSpanPx guards the DENOMINATOR. Every channel here is a percentage of
// the address ankle span, so a collapsed or mis-detected stance would divide a
// few pixels of noise by a few pixels of stance and emit hundreds of percent. A
// floor is the difference between "we could not measure this" and a confident
// absurdity; 40 px is well under any usable framing and well over the noise.
//
// kMinHipSpanRatio guards the hip LINE, which is a different failure from the
// denominator above. `lineTiltDeg` divides by the hips' horizontal separation, so as
// the pelvis turns toward the target the two hips foreshorten into the same image
// column, dx → 0 and the angle swings to ±90° — a −88° hip tilt just after impact is
// that, and it is not noise. It is a reading of the camera. Below the ratio the frame
// has NO hip line and is absent. The SAME RATIO is applied to the hip half of
// spineSideBend in upper_body_metrics, but that module resolves the line against its
// OWN address reference frames and its own denominator, so one key does not make the
// two agree frame by frame — one ratio, two references (see the note there).

//
// kMinShoulderSpanPx guards the DENOMINATOR, exactly as kMinStanceSpanPx does for
// the lower body. It is smaller (30 px) because the shoulder span is genuinely
// narrower than the stance in the same framing, so reusing the stance floor would
// refuse usable swings rather than absurd ones.
//
// kMinShoulderSpanRatio is the shoulder line's foreshortening gate, exactly what
// lowerBody::kMinHipSpanRatio is for the hip line and for the same geometric reason —
// a shoulder plane of +88° AT THE TOP, which is a GRADED phase sample, is the turn
// collapsing the span rather than a posture. It gates shoulderPlaneAngle, the shoulder
// half of spineSideBend, and trailElbowHeight — that last one is a height, not a tilt, but it
// interpolates the shoulder line's y at the elbow's x and so divides by the same dx,
// and an unbounded % shoulder width is worse than an angle that saturates at 90°.
// The hip half of spineSideBend uses lowerBody.minHipSpanRatio.
//
// kMinElbowSpanPx is the ELBOW line's gate, and it is an ABSOLUTE floor where the
// others are ratios — deliberately, because a ratio is INERT on this line. The elbows
// are at their NARROWEST at address (the arms hang together and separate through the
// swing), so |dx| / address |dx| is ≈1 at address and ≥1 everywhere else: the gate
// would never fire, and it would be exactly 1.0 at address, where a 20 px elbow
// separation is pure keypoint noise and `elbowAlignment` is READ. A ratio needs an

// then a Hermite sharing one slope at P7) put the clubhead-speed peak at the
// P6→P7 bracket MIDPOINT (−18 ms on the 08-18 LM pairs) with a 1 mph/ms decay
// into impact. With kEnabled the P7 anchor gets an IN rate (linear fit of the
// reconciled θ over the kWindowUs before P7, floored at the P6→P7 mean rate,
// which is smear-immune because both anchors are θ-crossing definitions) and an
// OUT rate (fit over the window after), and the bracket's start anchor an OUT
// rate fitted forward. The synthesized tier then carries the analytic rate of the
// curve it emits (synth.curveRate) so `clubheadSpeed` can compose from it.
// PROMOTED 2026-09-06 on the six 08-18 LM pairs (7-iron, 150 fps): peak time

// Gaussian at the impact frame and scaling the DP step prior across contact
// (×0.25) — because freeing θ at the blur frames made the pre-impact reading

// Clubhead speed / hand speed (mph) + lag angle (°) for the review chart — three
// UNSCORED per-frame curves derived purely from the face-on camera products: the
// shaft grip/head positions give the two linear speeds, and the lead-forearm vs
// clubshaft direction gives the lag angle. Prefer the dense synth shaft channel,
// fall back to the measured samples. Session-type-agnostic: the Wrist profile
// appends them (KinematicsStage) and the Swing/GRF/Coach analyzers reuse the same
// camera stages (Pose→Ball→Shaft) to produce them. Consumed by
// KinematicSeriesConfig::fromOverrides via the "kinematics.*" dotted key.
//
// kEnabled=false ⇒ KinematicsStage never runs (Wrist byte-identical) AND the
// Swing/GRF/Coach analyzers keep their instant stub (no pose/shaft compute) — the
// whole feature is dark and code-path-identical to before.
//
// ENABLED 2026-07-18 by product decision: this is an UNSCORED, additive display
// feature (three review-chart curves; it touches neither the score nor segmentation),
// its OFF state is proven byte-identical (swing_window_parity_test Test 4), and the ON
// path is verified end-to-end on a real Wrist swing (clubhead/hand speed + lag land in
// analysis.metrics with Address/Top/Impact dots). The corpus ON-eval (guide §6.6 gate
// 5) is a quality check on the curves, not a correctness gate — set false to dark it.

// FUSED club length, not the per-frame visible extent, which overshoots the club by

// against the six 08-18 LM pairs the reading at impact is 0.959 ± 0.022 of the monitor
// (was 1.004 ± 0.030 — but that was a mid-bracket peak decaying 1 mph/ms through the
// instant, i.e. two errors cancelling). The −4 % is the rate floor reading a lower bound
// of the instantaneous rate; it closes when the θ smear at impact does.
