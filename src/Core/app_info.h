// Read-only "about the running application" facade exposed to QML as the
// `appInfo` context property. Surfaces the app version / build stats, the host
// OS, and the versions of the third-party libraries this build links against —
// everything the About box (src/Gui/shell/PpAboutDialog.qml) renders.
//
// It deliberately depends only on version.h + the CMake-generated pp_version.h /
// pp_deps.h headers and QSysInfo/qVersion(), so it pulls in none of the heavy
// third-party headers (OpenCV, ONNX Runtime, FFmpeg, Spinnaker, …) — keeping it
// cheap to compile and free of link-order / delay-load hazards. Library presence
// is gated by the existing HAVE_* / WITH_* compile defines; only libraries
// actually compiled into this build appear in `dependencies`.
