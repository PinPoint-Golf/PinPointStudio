# Patch espeak-ng 1.52.0 to fix include-path pollution on macOS/Linux.
#
# espeak-include originally exposes include/compat via INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.
# That directory shadows system headers (<wctype.h>, <endian.h>) in consumers like
# PinPoint, causing compilation failures.
#
# Strategy:
#   FILE1  src/CMakeLists.txt
#     Strip include/compat from espeak-include's public INTERFACE so it never
#     leaks to consumers.
#
#   FILE2  src/libespeak-ng/CMakeLists.txt
#     1. Keep the espeak-include link as PUBLIC (needed by espeak-ng-bin).
#     2. Re-add include/compat explicitly as PRIVATE to the espeak-ng library
#        itself — espeak-ng needs its own compat shims (endian.h, wctype.h …)
#        at compile time, but those shims must not propagate to consumers.
#
# Pass: -DFILE1=<abs_path_src_CMakeLists> -DFILE2=<abs_path_libespeak-ng_CMakeLists>
